## Why Meaning Is Not a Canon Value

In **MOQ Values Matter**, *meaning* is deliberately **not** treated as a Canon value pattern.

This is not because meaning is unimportant, but because it is **ontologically derivative**.

Meaning does not function as a primary value pattern within the Metaphysics of Quality.  
Instead, it appears as a **felt coherence-effect** when multiple value patterns align across levels.

## Meaning Is an Outcome, Not a Driver

Canon value patterns must be:
- operationally distinguishable  
- stable under analysis  
- identifiable by characteristic failure modes  
- evaluable independently  

Meaning fails these criteria.

Meaning does not *bind*, *enforce*, *discover*, or *preserve*.  
It does not operate directly at any MOQ level.

Rather, meaning is **what it feels like when other value patterns succeed**.

- Truth contributes meaning when representations correspond to reality.
- Integrity contributes meaning when actions align with principles.
- Faith contributes meaning by sustaining orientation toward future coherence.
- Hope contributes meaning by keeping systems open under uncertainty.
- Myth contributes meaning by binding individuals into shared narrative structure.

Meaning is therefore **the experiential resonance of value coherence**, not a value pattern in its own right.

## Why Meaning Cannot Be Canonical

When meaning is treated as a primary value, analysis collapses.

It becomes:
- circular
- self-referential
- immune to critique
- vulnerable to ideological or linguistic capture

Philosophical systems that elevate meaning to first principle often end up reconstructing meaning from within meaning itself — an **incomplete metaphysics**.

In MOQ terms, meaning lacks an independent **persistence logic**.  
Its stability is entirely borrowed from other value patterns.

## Meaning as a Diagnostic Signal

Within this project, meaning functions as a **diagnostic indicator**, not a Canon object.

- High meaning usually signals cross-level coherence.
- Loss of meaning usually signals value conflict, suppression, or distortion.
- Artificial meaning often signals mythic capture without integrity or truth.

Meaning tells us *how well* a value system is functioning — not *what* that system is.

## Alignment with the Metaphysics of Quality

This position is fully consistent with the Metaphysics of Quality as articulated by :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

Quality precedes meaning.  
Value precedes interpretation.  
Dynamic Quality precedes all conceptualization.

Meaning appears **after** value patterns stabilize — never before.

## Canon Position

Accordingly, in **MOQ Values Matter**:

- Meaning is not a Canon value pattern  
- Meaning is not a law-level construct  
- Meaning is not a cluster root  

Meaning is a **secondary, emergent, phenomenological effect** produced by aligned value patterns across biological, social, and intellectual levels.

Treating meaning this way preserves analytical clarity, prevents category errors, and protects Canon stability.
