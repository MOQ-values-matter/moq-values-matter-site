description: An examination of why language-centered artificial intelligence systems cannot generate genuine coherence, and why a value-centered framework—respecting the limits of formalization—is essential for AI, robotics, and AGI.

## Introduction

The previous essays argued that language does not ground coherence, but depends on value as a primary reality. This insight reaches directly into one of the defining technological questions of our time: **artificial intelligence**.

Large language models demonstrate extraordinary capabilities. They generate fluent text, synthesize knowledge, and participate convincingly in dialogue. Yet there is growing recognition—even within AI research—that **language alone is not sufficient for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**.

This essay argues that the limitation is not merely technical. It is **ontological**.

To understand why, we must recognize a distinction that is present throughout this project but must be handled with care: the distinction between **what can be stabilized and formalized** and **what cannot**.

---

## Language Models as Static Systems

Language models operate entirely on **stabilized patterns**.

They are trained on:
- accumulated linguistic artifacts
- codified judgments
- historically preserved norms
- already-settled interpretations

This is not a flaw. It is precisely what makes them useful.

But it is also a boundary.

Language itself is a stabilized product of prior human evaluation. Language models therefore operate on **the residue of past value judgments**, not on value formation itself.

They do not originate novelty.  
They do not revise value hierarchies.  
They recombine what has already been retained.

---

## Novelty Cannot Be Specified

One of the recurring errors in both philosophy and AI research is the attempt to *specify in advance* what improvement should look like.

But genuine improvement is only recognizable **after** it has occurred.

If it could be fully specified beforehand, it would already belong to what has been stabilized.

This is not a limitation of engineering skill. It is a structural feature of reality.

Language-based systems therefore cannot be the source of genuine novelty. They can only:
- preserve
- extend
- recombine
- accelerate

They cannot originate the criteria by which “better” is discovered.

---

## Why Multimodality Is Still Insufficient

The move toward multimodal AI—vision, audio, robotics, sensorimotor systems—is often presented as the solution to language-only limitations.

Multimodality is necessary.  
But it does not resolve the core issue.

Sensors provide information.  
They do not provide orientation.

A system may perceive more of the world and still lack any intrinsic distinction between improvement and degradation. Without that distinction, perception remains observational.

Increasing input channels does not change this boundary.

---

## Value Is Not a Configuration

A particularly dangerous misunderstanding in contemporary AI discourse is the belief that values can be:
- specified as rules
- encoded as objectives
- enforced through constraints
- toggled through configuration

This treats value as if it were a static parameter.

But value hierarchies are not static inventories. They are **living structured ecosystems**, sustained by ongoing interaction between preservation and revision.

Freezing a particular static interpretation of “good” and enforcing it at scale does not preserve value. It suppresses the conditions under which value adapts.

This is not an abstract concern. Human systems provide abundant evidence.

---

## Static Capture and Ideological Enforcement

When social systems lock a particular interpretation of “good” into institutions and enforce it without regard for context, consequence, or correction, they tend to degrade while maintaining moral self-certainty.

This pattern does not require bad intentions.  
It arises from **static overreach**.

The same risk applies to AI systems aligned to narrowly defined values without understanding their place in a broader hierarchy.

An AI rigidly enforcing poorly understood values is not safe.  
It is brittle.

---

## AI Alignment Has Structural Limits

Alignment presumes that what should be aligned *can be specified*.

But the most important distinctions—what counts as improvement, when rules should bend, when preservation becomes stagnation—cannot be fully formalized.

As long as artificial systems operate only on stabilized patterns, responsibility for value recognition remains human.

This is not a failure of AI.  
It is a category boundary.

---

## Reframing AGI

From a value-centered perspective, AGI is not primarily a question of intelligence, capability, or generality.

It is a question of **orientation**.

A system that cannot revise its own stabilizations without external authority will always remain subordinate to those who define its constraints.

This does not make such systems useless.  
It makes their limits visible.

---

## Implications for AI, Robotics, and Governance

A sober view follows:

- Language models are **static-pattern amplifiers**, not value originators.
- Multimodal systems extend representation, not valuation.
- Alignment without hierarchy awareness risks systemic harm.
- Human responsibility remains non-transferable.

Most importantly:

**Value is not something systems can be configured to obey without understanding how it emerges and changes.**

---

## Closing

Language-based AI cannot be enough because language itself is downstream of what matters.

Static systems preserve.  
They do not originate.

The danger ahead is not intelligence exceeding control, but static enforcement without understanding.

Avoiding that danger requires restraint, humility, and clarity about what can—and cannot—be formalized.

Some things must remain recognized only after the fact.

That is not a weakness.  
It is what makes progress possible.

Values matter.
