## Introduction

The previous essays argued that the linguistic turn failed not because language is unimportant, but because language was asked to carry explanatory weight it cannot bear. Once value is restored as the primary foundation, many of the central insights of twentieth-century language philosophy can be retained — but only if they are **re-situated**.

This essay does not aim to refute the major linguistic thinkers. Nor does it aim to synthesize them into a single framework. Its purpose is more precise: to show what each of them was *actually tracking*, what level of reality they were responding to, and why their accounts became unstable when treated as complete.

Seen through a value-centered lens, these thinkers are no longer competitors offering incompatible foundations. They become **partial observers of different value functions**, each mistaking a critical layer for the whole.

## A Pattern of Incompletion

Across the linguistic turn, a recurring pattern appears:

1. A genuine problem is identified  
2. A real constraint on language is discovered  
3. That constraint is elevated into a foundation  
4. Other constraints are dismissed or dissolved  

The result is not error, but imbalance.

A value-centered framework allows us to keep step (2) while correcting step (3).

## Structural and Formal Thinkers  
*Capacity without orientation*

Structural and formal approaches focused on the internal mechanics of language: how symbols combine, how generativity is achieved, and how regularity emerges across speakers and cultures.

Figures such as Saussure and Chomsky made decisive contributions here. They explained how language is *possible* as a system at all — how finite biological and cognitive resources can support infinite expression.

Reinterpreted through value:

- These theories describe the **biological and formal prerequisites** for value tracking
- They explain *capacity*, not *direction*
- They clarify constraints on symbol manipulation, not why symbols matter

Their limitation arises only when formal capacity is mistaken for explanatory sufficiency. Without value orientation, structure floats.

## Pragmatic and Use-Based Thinkers  
*Stabilization without hierarchy*

Pragmatic approaches emphasized how language works in practice: how meaning stabilizes through use, how rules emerge from participation, and how understanding is embedded in forms of life.

Later Wittgenstein, Austin, and Searle are central here.

Reinterpreted through value:

- These theories describe **local value stabilization**
- They explain how shared practices coordinate expectations
- They illuminate how coherence is maintained within bounded contexts

Their refusal to theorize beyond practice was methodologically cautious — but metaphysically costly. Without an account of value hierarchy, pragmatics cannot explain why some practices generalize, why translation works, or why breakdowns count as failures rather than alternatives.

Practice explains *how* language holds together.  
Value explains *why* some forms endure.

## Critical and Deconstructive Thinkers  
*Detection without grounding*

Critical and deconstructive approaches focused on instability, exclusion, and power embedded in language. They revealed how linguistic systems can conceal asymmetries, enforce norms, and marginalize alternatives.

Derrida and post-structuralist traditions are exemplary here.

Reinterpreted through value:

- These theories detect **value misalignment and capture**
- They identify when language ceases to track lived reality
- They reveal how symbols can drift away from what they claim to represent

Their failure is not diagnostic, but foundational. By denying any grounding beyond language, critique consumes its own standards. If no value hierarchy exists, critique cannot distinguish distortion from revision, or degradation from transformation.

Critique requires a value reference point.  
Without it, critique collapses into perpetual negation.

---

## Psychodynamic and Expressive Thinkers  
*Pressure without constraint*

Some thinkers extended linguistic critique into subjectivity, embodiment, and expression, treating language as a site where bodily, emotional, and political forces erupt.

Figures such as Kristeva and Cixous belong here.

Reinterpreted through value:

- These approaches register **value pressure entering language**
- They highlight what formal and pragmatic models suppress
- They surface tensions between lived experience and symbolic order

Their contribution is real, but unstable when elevated to principle. When disruption itself is treated as inherently virtuous, value discrimination collapses. Expression without constraint cannot distinguish revelation from noise.

Value pressure is necessary.  
Value discernment is indispensable.

---

## Why They Could Not Converge

The linguistic turn did not fail to converge because the thinkers were careless or incoherent. It failed because each tradition was tracking a **different function of language**, while lacking a shared metaphysical ground to relate those functions coherently.

Without value as a primary reference:

- Structure competed with practice
- Practice resisted hierarchy
- Critique dissolved standards
- Expression rejected constraint

Each position defended itself by denying what it could not explain.

---

## What a Value-Centered Reinterpretation Preserves

A value-centered framework does not discard these thinkers. It **repositions** them.

- Formal theories describe *capacity*
- Pragmatic theories describe *stabilization*
- Critical theories describe *misalignment*
- Expressive theories describe *pressure*
- Value theory describes *orientation and hierarchy*

Once these roles are distinguished, the apparent contradictions dissolve.

The thinkers were not wrong.  
They were incomplete — without proper metaphysical grounding.

---

## Transition

Reinterpreting the linguistic thinkers clarifies the past. It does not yet explain the present.

Language today is not merely a philosophical puzzle. It is a systemic force shaping institutions, governance, technology, and social trust. The consequences of misaligned language are no longer theoretical.

The final essay turns to this question:

**Why does this matter now?**

---

## Closing

The linguistic turn taught philosophy how fragile language can be. What it failed to explain is why language works at all.

Restoring value as primary does not negate the insights of twentieth-century language philosophy. It gives them a place to stand.

Only from there can language be judged, repaired, and responsibly extended — not as a self-enclosed system of signs, but as a human instrument embedded in what matters.
