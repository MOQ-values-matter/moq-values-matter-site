## What This Page Is

This is the **hub** for Circle / Ripple Theory.

It does not restate the essays.  
It ties them together, provides reading order, and points to the shared vocabulary and diagrams that keep the series coherent.

If you are new: start with **Essay 01**.  
If you are here to use the framework: start with the **Executive & Coaching Guide**.

## Canon Status

This series is **Canon**.  
Essays 01–06 define the binding model. Derivative texts must conform to them.

- **Canon glossary:** see *Governance → Canon Glossary*  
- **Diagram key:** see *Governance → Diagram Key*  
- **Status labels:** see *Governance → Canon vs Exploratory*

---

## The Model in One Line

- **Individuals are value nodes**
- **Circles are multi-level value fields**
- **Actions emit ripples**
- **Reciprocity builds reserves**
- **Power enforces boundaries**
- **Coercion substitutes for failed reciprocity**
- **Collapse follows reserve depletion**
- **Repair requires costly re-patterning**
- **All circles are bound in a keychain**

Each essay clarifies one segment of this chain.

## Recommended Reading Order (Core Canon)

1. **Essay 01 — Core Metaphor**  
   *Defines the visual language: nodes, circles, ripples, priming, and level propagation.*

2. **Essay 02 — The Individual as a Value Node**  
   *What it means to live as a node: priming, internal compass, emission and responsibility.*

3. **Essay 03 — Circles as Value Fields**  
   *Circles as multi-level anchored fields; field-relative valuation without relativism; the keychain constraint.*

4. **Essay 04 — Reciprocity, Betrayal, and Field Collapse**  
   *Reserves, asymmetry, betrayal as extraction, and why collapse accelerates.*

5. **Essay 05 — Power, Enforcement, and the Limits of Coercion**  
   *Power as social necessity; enforcement vs coercion; coercion as substitution and its hard limits.*

6. **Essay 06 — Repair, Forgiveness, and Re-entry into the Field**  
   *Repair as re-patterning; forgiveness as structural risk; re-entry as conditional and costly.*

## Use-Oriented Entries (Start Here If You Need Practical)

- **Executive & Coaching Guide**  
  A non-philosophical interface to the same model, designed for leadership and coaching use.

- **Synthesis — Circle / Ripple Theory as an Operational Model**  
  A single integrated view of Essays 01–06 as one diagnostic and action framework.

---

## Diagram Set (Visual Backbone)

The essays align to a shared diagram language. Use these when teaching, coaching, or presenting:

- **Legend / Visual Language Lock**
- **Family Field one-pagers (1–4)**
- **Ripple chain and keychain diagrams**

(These live under the `diagrams/` folder in this section.)

## Quick Start Paths

### If you want understanding
Read **01 → 06** in order.

### If you want application now
Read **Executive Guide → 03 → 04 → 06**  
(then return to 01–02 for deeper grounding).

### If you are working with breakdown or conflict
Read **04 → 05 → 06**, then loop back to **02–03**.

## Contribution Rule (Important)

If you add new content in this area:

- use the Canon glossary terms
- keep MOQ level boundaries strict (stories and meaning are social; reasoning and correction are intellectual)
- avoid moral relativism: local valuation ≠ high Quality
- label your content **Canon / Exploratory / Application** explicitly

---

## Closing Orientation

Circle / Ripple Theory is a tool for clarity.

If any essay or diagram stops clarifying lived reality, revise it—  
but do so explicitly, under governance, and without drifting terms.

Start with **Essay 01**, or jump to the **Executive & Coaching Guide** if you need practical entry.
