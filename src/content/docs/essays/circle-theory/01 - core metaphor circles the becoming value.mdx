title: Core Metaphor — Circles, Ripples, and the Becoming Value Node
description: A holistic value metaphor for understanding how actions propagate across physical, biological, social, and intellectual levels, shaping individuals and the circles they inhabit.
---

## Why This Metaphor Exists

Human life is lived inside **fields of influence** long before it is understood through concepts.

We are shaped before we choose.
Primed before we judge.
Moved before we explain.

Circle / Ripple Theory exists to give form to this reality — not as a theory of society, but as a **tool for orientation, interpretation, and self-development**.

It does not explain everything.
It helps us *see* what we are already inside.

---

## The Core Image

The core image is deliberately simple:

- **Reality is composed of overlapping value fields**
- **Actions generate value ripples**
- **Ripples propagate across all MOQ levels**
- **Individuals are living value nodes, constantly becoming**
- **Circles are zones where ripples reinforce, cancel, or collide**

This metaphor is powerful because it allows **extreme complexity to be understood visually**, without reducing it to slogans or rules.

---

## Value Ripples Exist at All Levels

Ripples are not limited to the social level.

Every action releases value effects that propagate simultaneously through:

- **Physical reality**  
  (force, movement, damage, shelter, infrastructure, tools)

- **Biological reality**  
  (fear, stress, arousal, injury, bonding, exhaustion, confidence)

- **Social reality**  
  (trust, loyalty, fear, resentment, status, belonging)

- **Intellectual reality**  
  (meaning, justification, narratives, expectations, beliefs)

The same action can:
- destroy at one level
- reinforce at another
- inspire at a third

No action is value-neutral.

---

## The Individual as a Becoming Value Node

An individual is not a fixed entity.
An individual is a **becoming value node**.

From birth onward, the human being is immersed in:
- biological ripples (care, neglect, threat, safety)
- social ripples (approval, shame, inclusion, exclusion)
- intellectual ripples (stories, explanations, myths, expectations)

These ripples **prime the individual**.

Over time, through countless yes/no experiences, the individual develops:
- an internal sense of better and worse
- a direction of pull
- a value compass

This compass is not purely rational.
It is **grown**, not chosen.

And it feeds forward:
> the individual does not only receive ripples —  
> the individual *emits* them.

---

## Circles as Zones of Value Resonance

A **circle** is not primarily a social structure.

It is a **zone of value resonance** — a region where certain ripples are:
- amplified
- rewarded
- normalized
- punished
- suppressed

Families, gangs, teams, organizations, cultures, and nations all function this way.

A circle does not ask:
> “Is this action good in general?”

It asks:
> “Does this action strengthen *our* field?”

This is not a moral flaw.
It is a structural reality.

## One Action, Many Meanings

Consider a single violent act.

Within one circle, the action may generate:
- admiration
- status
- confidence
- belonging

Within another circle, the same action generates:
- grief
- rage
- fear
- resolve for retaliation

Within the individual actor:
- adrenaline and empowerment may rise
- guilt may fall silent
- identity may harden

Within surrounding circles:
- families tense
- communities grow suspicious
- institutions prepare
- narratives form

One action.
Many ripples.
Many value readings.

The metaphor makes this visible **without moral confusion**.

---

## Collision, Feedback, and Escalation

Ripples do not travel indefinitely without response.

They:
- meet resistance
- trigger counter-ripples
- accumulate energy
- sometimes return amplified

This is why:
- violence escalates
- trust collapses suddenly
- reputations flip
- “unexpected consequences” are common

Not because reality is chaotic —
but because **value propagation is multi-layered and delayed**.

---

## Priming, Expectation, and the Invisible Push

Ripples do not only follow actions.
They follow **expectations**.

Fear primes fear.
Trust primes trust.
Suspicion primes interpretation.

Like the butterfly effect or the Pygmalion effect, small value signals can:
- change perception
- alter behavior
- create self-fulfilling futures

This is why:
- environments matter
- tone matters
- history matters
- attention matters

The metaphor keeps this in view.

---

## What This Metaphor Is For

Circle / Ripple Theory is not meant to judge others.

It is meant to help an individual ask:
- *What ripples am I generating?*
- *Which circles amplify them?*
- *Which parts of me are being primed — and by whom?*
- *What future am I quietly feeding?*

It is a mirror, not a weapon.

---

## What This Metaphor Does Not Do

This framework does **not**:

- define good and evil
- replace moral reasoning
- predict outcomes with certainty
- explain the origin of novelty

The emergence of new value still belongs to **Dynamic Quality**.

Circle Theory begins **after** emergence —
when value starts to move, collide, stabilize, or decay.

## Orientation Going Forward

All following essays will build on this core metaphor.

Terms such as:
- ripple
- priming
- value node
- resonance
- amplification
- collision
- decay

will always refer back to the logic established here.

If the metaphor ever stops clarifying lived experience,
it should be revised or abandoned.

Its only justification is this:

> Does it help a person see their life — and their responsibility — more clearly?
