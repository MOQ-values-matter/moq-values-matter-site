# MOQ Values Matter

> **Values matter.**

This site is a living knowledge atlas grounded in **Robert Pirsig’s Metaphysics of Quality (MOQ)**.
It aims to preserve **clear distinctions**, **stable definitions**, and **high-quality reasoning** across the MOQ levels.

## Start here

- **Foundation (MOQ Canonical Ground):**  
  /fundamentals/

- **Value Atlas (value patterns and analyses):**  
  /atlas/

- **Essays (explorations and syntheses):**  
  /essays/

## How the site is organized

- **Fundamentals** — core reference material (laws, definitions, structure)
- **Value Atlas** — value patterns (drafts and canon candidates)
- **Essays** — interpretive writing and applications (not Canon by default)
- **Governance** — rules that protect Canon stability and quality

## Project stance

This project treats **value as primary**.
It does not claim final truth.
It does claim that **some patterns are higher-quality than others**, and that clarity and coherence are worth protecting.

**Values matter.**
