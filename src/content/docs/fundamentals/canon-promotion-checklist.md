title: Canon Promotion Checklist
description: Criteria for promoting a Value Atlas entry to Canon status.
---

## Purpose

This checklist defines the criteria required for a Value Atlas entry to be promoted to **Canon** status.

Canon status denotes **intellectual stabilization**, not final truth.
An entry is Canon when it has achieved sufficient coherence, grounding, and explanatory power to persist as a high-quality static intellectual pattern under current conditions.

Status progression:

**Draft → Reviewed → Canon**

All criteria below must pass.

---

## A. Structural Integrity (Hard Gates)

### ☐ A1. Canonical Structure Complete
- All **8 canonical sections** are present and ordered correctly.
- No section is omitted, merged, or replaced.
- Section headings match the canonical wording exactly.

**Fail condition:** Missing or altered sections.

---

### ☐ A2. Internal Coherence (Non-Contradiction)
- Definitions, evaluations, analyses, and verdict do not contradict each other.
- Multi-level scores are justified by the analysis.
- The verdict follows logically from preceding sections.

**Fail condition:** Internal inconsistency or unresolved contradiction.

---

## B. MOQ Integrity (Level Discipline)

### ☐ B1. Cross-Level Respect
- No MOQ level is reduced to another.
- Physical, biological, and social constraints are acknowledged where relevant.
- Intellectual analysis does not override lower-level realities.

**Fail condition:** Reductionism or intellectual overreach.

---

### ☐ B2. Multi-Level Evaluation Stability
- Level scores (0–2) reflect dominant tendencies, not edge cases.
- Scoring logic is consistent with other Canon entries.
- Context-dependence is explicitly stated if present.

**Fail condition:** Arbitrary or unstable scoring.

---

## C. Reality Anchoring

### ☐ C1. Empirical Grounding
- Evidence is drawn from observable domains (history, institutions, behavior, etc.).
- Examples are representative rather than cherry-picked.
- Speculative claims are clearly marked as such.

**Fail condition:** Purely abstract or unfalsifiable reasoning.

---

### ☐ C2. Persistence Logic Plausibility
- Clear mechanisms explain why the pattern persists across time or cultures.
- Persistence is not equated with moral legitimacy.
- Conditions under which persistence weakens are identified.

**Fail condition:** Teleological or inevitability claims.

---

## D. Intellectual Excellence (MOQ Laws of the Intellect)

### ☐ D1. Explanatory Gain
- The entry increases orientation, clarity, or understanding.
- It explains something non-trivial.
- It integrates multiple observations into a coherent pattern.

**Fail condition:** Redescription without added insight.

---

### ☐ D2. Comparative Superiority
- Competing explanations or framings are acknowledged (explicitly or implicitly).
- It is clear why this pattern is retained over alternatives.

**Fail condition:** Unexamined exclusivity or framework capture.

---

### ☐ D3. Conceptual Humility
- Boundary conditions are stated.
- Known failure modes are identified.
- The pattern is, in principle, falsifiable or corrigible.

**Fail condition:** Absolutism or hidden dogma.

---

## E. Verdict Stability

### ☐ E1. MoQ Coherence Verdict Settled
- The verdict is clear and conditionally framed where appropriate.
- No unresolved internal objections remain.
- The verdict does not depend on speculative future developments.

**Fail condition:** Oscillating or provisional verdict.

---

## F. Canon Readiness

### ☐ F1. Summary Schema Consistency
- Summary schema is complete and standardized.
- Schema elements are comparable across other Canon entries.

**Fail condition:** Ambiguous or non-standard schema.

---

### ☐ F2. Revision Transparency
- Revision notes are complete and up to date.
- Changes leading to Canon status are documented.
- Rationale for Canon promotion is explicitly stated.

**Fail condition:** Silent edits or undocumented promotion.

---

## Canon Promotion Rule

An entry may be promoted to **Canon** only if **all checklist items pass without exception**.

If any item fails:
- Status remains **Reviewed**
- Failed criteria must be addressed explicitly
- Partial Canon designation is not permitted

---

## Required Canon Declaration

When an entry is promoted to Canon, append the following text verbatim to its Revision Notes:

> **Canon Declaration:**  
> This entry has been evaluated against the Canon Promotion Checklist (v1) and is designated Canon on the basis of intellectual coherence, cross-level integrity, empirical grounding, and explanatory stability under current conditions.

---

## Scope Note

This checklist evaluates **intellectual stabilization**, not moral approval, consensus, or institutional endorsement.

Canon entries persist because they remain the **best stabilized intellectual patterns available** under current conditions.
