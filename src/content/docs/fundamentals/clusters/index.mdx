**Description**: Structural cluster pages that organize relationships between Canon value patterns without introducing new claims.


## Purpose of Canon Clusters

Canon clusters are **structural reference pages** that organize and relate **already-Canon value patterns**.

They exist to:
- clarify how Canon patterns interact
- stabilize cross-pattern relationships
- prevent conceptual drift or accidental reduction
- provide navigational and explanatory structure

Clusters do **not** define new values, laws, or patterns.  
They **do not compete** with the Value Atlas or the Fundamental Laws.

Clusters are **maps**, not terrain.

## What a Canon Cluster Is

A Canon cluster:
- relates two or more **existing Canon entries**
- explains their **functional roles and tensions**
- preserves MOQ level boundaries
- introduces **no new evaluative content**
- does not revise the meaning of any linked entry

Clusters are authoritative only insofar as they reflect **existing Canon** accurately.

---

## What a Canon Cluster Is Not

A Canon cluster is **not**:
- an essay or article
- an interpretive lens
- a new framework
- a proposal or hypothesis
- a replacement for individual Atlas entries
- a place for persuasion or rhetoric

If a page introduces a new idea, it does **not** belong here.

## Relationship to Other Canon Structures

| Structure | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Fundamental Laws | Define invariant constraints across MOQ levels |
| Value Atlas Entries | Define and analyze individual value patterns |
| **Canon Clusters** | Organize relationships between Canon patterns |
| Essays | Explore, test, or challenge Canon (non-binding) |

Clusters sit **between** laws and atlas entries as **organizational glue**, not as a new layer of theory.

---

## Canon Discipline (Mandatory)

All Canon clusters must:
- reference **only Canon entries**
- preserve original definitions verbatim
- avoid moralizing language
- avoid intellectual overreach
- avoid Dynamic Quality formalization
- remain stable unless Canon entries themselves change

If a Canon entry changes, clusters may be updated **only to restore accuracy**, not to reinterpret.

---

## Current Canon Clusters

- **Myth–Integrity–Deception–Truth**  
  A foundational social–intellectual cluster explaining how meaning, agency, distortion, and correction interact in human systems.

(Additional clusters may be added as Canon grows.)


## When a New Canon Cluster Is Justified

A new Canon cluster is justified **only** when existing Canon entries exhibit a **stable, recurring structural relationship** that cannot be clearly expressed through individual Atlas entries or cross-links alone.

A cluster may be created **only if all conditions below are met**.

---

### Mandatory Criteria (All Required)

A proposed Canon cluster MUST:

1. **Reference two or more existing Canon entries**
   - No Draft or exploratory entries may be clustered.
   - A cluster cannot be used to promote Draft content implicitly.

2. **Describe relationships, not new patterns**
   - The cluster may organize, compare, or contrast Canon entries.
   - It must not define, rename, or reinterpret any value pattern.

3. **Resolve structural ambiguity**
   - The relationship between the entries must be:
     - recurrent,
     - non-trivial,
     - and important for correct understanding.
   - If simple cross-linking is sufficient, a cluster is not justified.

4. **Preserve MOQ hierarchy and boundaries**
   - No cluster may collapse levels.
   - No intellectual values may be smuggled into social patterns.
   - No moral elevation or demotion of patterns is permitted.

5. **Introduce zero new evaluative claims**
   - The cluster must be derivable entirely from existing Canon.
   - Any sentence that could not be defended by pointing to an existing Canon entry is forbidden.

### Common Valid Reasons for a Cluster

A Canon cluster is typically justified when:

- A **set of patterns forms a stable configuration** (e.g. opposition, dependency, triad, or cycle)
- Misunderstanding the relationship leads to **systematic analytical errors**
- The patterns are frequently invoked together in analysis
- The interaction explains **system stability or failure modes** better than isolated entries

The Myth–Integrity–Deception–Truth cluster satisfies these conditions by explaining:
- how meaning binds,
- how agency stabilizes,
- how distortion scales,
- and how correction occurs.

---

### Invalid Reasons for a Cluster

A Canon cluster must NOT be created because:

- the patterns are thematically similar
- the author finds the grouping elegant or persuasive
- it feels pedagogically convenient
- it advances a normative or ideological position
- it replaces the need to read individual entries

Clusters exist to **clarify structure**, not to simplify thought.

---

### Cluster Review Standard

Before designation as Canon, a proposed cluster must be reviewed to confirm:

- no new claims are introduced
- all relationships are explicitly traceable to Canon entries
- removal of the cluster would reduce cl

---

## Canon Status

Cluster pages are Canon by designation when they:
- reference only Canon material
- introduce no new claims
- preserve hierarchy and boundaries
- pass structural review
