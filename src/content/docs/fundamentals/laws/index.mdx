description: A visual overview of the four MOQ levels and their governing laws.

## The Four Levels of Value (MOQ)

The Metaphysics of Quality describes reality as structured by **four nested levels of static value**, each governing a different mode of stability.

Each higher level:
- emerges from the lower
- constrains the lower
- must respect the lower to remain viable

---

## Visual Hierarchy Overview


Dynamic Quality is not a level.  
It is the **source of novelty** that passes through all levels before stabilizing.

## Level-by-Level Index

### Physical Level — Stability of Being
**Core function:** Persistence of pattern  
**Primary value:** Stability

Key laws:
- Conservation (Persistence of Value)
- Entropy (Return to Dynamic Potential)
- Relativity (Relational Being)
- Symmetry (Harmony)
- Causality (Coherent Sequence)
- Quantum Potential (Potential & Actuality)

→ See: [/fundamentals/laws/physical/](/fundamentals/laws/physical/)

### Biological Level — Continuity of Life
**Core function:** Resistance to entropy through life  
**Primary value:** Vitality

Key laws:
- Preserve Pattern
- Adapt
- Reproduce
- Cooperate
- Renew

→ See: [/fundamentals/laws/biological/](/fundamentals/laws/biological/)

---

### Social Level — Stability Through Coordination
**Core function:** Group survival and order  
**Primary value:** Cohesion

Key laws:
- Hierarchy
- Loyalty
- Reciprocity
- Protection
- Continuity
- Sanction

→ See: [/fundamentals/laws/social/](/fundamentals/laws/social/)

---

### Intellectual Level — Coherence of Meaning
**Core function:** Truth-seeking and understanding  
**Primary value:** Excellence

Key laws:
- Distinction
- Coherence
- Correspondence
- Inquiry
- Integrity
- Communication
- Synthesis
- Reverence for Quality

→ See: [/fundamentals/laws/intellectual/](/fundamentals/laws/intellectual/)

## Cross-Level Principle

Each level solves a problem the level below cannot:

| Level | Solves the Problem of |
|---|---|
| Physical | How anything can persist at all |
| Biological | How persistence becomes life |
| Social | How many lives coordinate |
| Intellectual | How meaning and truth emerge |

Higher levels **do not replace** lower ones.  
They **depend on them**.

## Reading Guide

- Start with **Physical** to understand the base rhythm of reality  
- Move to **Biological** to see how life resists entropy  
- Study **Social** to understand power, order, and cohesion  
- Enter **Intellectual** to see how truth, wisdom, and meaning arise  

No level is optional.  
Ignoring lower levels destabilizes higher ones.

---

## Essence

Reality is not built from things,  
but from **values that learned how to last**.

The four levels are the memory of that learning.
