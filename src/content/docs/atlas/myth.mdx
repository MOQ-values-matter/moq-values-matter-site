## 1. Neutral Definition

**Myth** is a social value pattern in which shared narratives, symbols, roles, and meanings bind individuals into coordinated action, identity, and obligation.

Myth does not aim at factual accuracy or intellectual coherence.  
Its function is **meaning-binding**, not truth-tracking.

Myth provides:
- collective identity (“who we are”)
- moral orientation (“what matters”)
- role legitimacy (“who may do what”)
- justification for sacrifice
- continuity across generations

A myth is effective when it **mobilizes will**, not when it corresponds to reality.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0  
Myth has no direct effect on physical systems, which operate independently of meaning or belief.

### Biological — 1  
Myth can enhance biological survival indirectly by strengthening group cohesion, morale, and willingness to endure hardship, but may also drive costly or lethal behavior.

### Social — 2  
Myth is a foundational social pattern. It enables:
- large-scale coordination
- loyalty and enforcement
- legitimacy of authority
- shared meaning and motivation
- persistence of social structures over time

Without myth, complex social systems cannot sustain collective action.

### Intellectual — 0  
Myth does not seek explanation, coherence, or correction. When treated as truth, myth suppresses intellectual patterns.

---

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Myth primarily serves **social coherence**.

Cross-level dynamics:
- **Social enablement:** Myth binds individuals into durable collective structures capable of coordinated action.
- **Intellectual tension:** Myth resists correction when challenged by truth, especially when identity or legitimacy is threatened.
- **Biological amplification:** Fear, hope, belonging, and honor intensify myth adherence.

Myth creates stability through meaning, not accuracy.  
Its coherence is **narrative**, not logical.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies  
Among allies, myth:
- strengthens identity and loyalty
- reduces coordination ambiguity
- legitimizes mutual obligation and sacrifice

### Neutrals  
For outsiders, myth:
- defines boundaries of inclusion and exclusion
- signals values and intentions
- may appear arbitrary or opaque

### Adversaries  
For adversaries, myth:
- frames enemies symbolically
- justifies conflict or exclusion
- simplifies complex realities into moral roles

### Internal POV Group  
Within the group, myth:
- anchors identity
- provides existential meaning
- suppresses ambiguity
- rewards conformity and role fidelity

---

## 5. Persistence Logic

Myth persists because it:
- satisfies the human need for meaning and belonging
- stabilizes identity across time
- reduces cognitive and moral uncertainty
- legitimizes authority and hierarchy
- enables large-scale cooperation without constant enforcement

Myth weakens when:
- reality constraints impose repeated failure
- internal contradictions accumulate
- alternative myths gain traction
- enforcement costs exceed cohesion benefits

Persistence does not imply accuracy or moral legitimacy.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Myth is observable across:
- religions and cosmologies
- national founding narratives
- honor and shame cultures
- revolutionary ideologies
- corporate and institutional “mission stories”
- heroic, martyrdom, and origin myths

Anthropological evidence shows no stable society without mythic structures.

---

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Myth is a **socially indispensable but intellectually non-corrective pattern**.

- **Primary alignment:** Social coordination, identity, and meaning
- **Primary conflict:** Intellectual truth and correction
- **Relationship to Dynamic Quality:** Ambivalent — myth can preserve space for novelty, but often resists revision once institutionalized

Myth becomes **degenerative** when:
- treated as factual truth
- insulated from revision
- enforced through deception rather than integrity

Myth becomes **high-value** when:
- openly symbolic
- supported by integrity
- revisable under sustained failure

## 8. Summary Schema

- **Primary MOQ level:** Social  
- **Typical score profile:** Physical 0 / Biological 1 / Social 2 / Intellectual 0  
- **Coherence type:** Meaning-binding and stabilizing  
- **Persistence drivers:** Identity, belonging, legitimacy, sacrifice  
- **Common failure mode:** Dogmatization and resistance to correction  
- **Related patterns:**  
  - **Integrity** — stabilizing constraint within myth  
  - **Deception** — parasitic myth manipulation  
  - **Truth** — corrective intellectual counter-pattern  
  - **Propaganda** — operationalized myth control
