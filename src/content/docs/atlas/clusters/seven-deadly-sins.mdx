title: The Seven Deadly Sins
description: A structured exploration of seven historically persistent value patterns, analyzed as systemic failure modes within the Metaphysics of Quality.
status: Draft
---

## Purpose and Scope

The **Seven Deadly Sins** are presented here not as moral prohibitions, but as **historically persistent value patterns** that recur across cultures, institutions, and individual lives.

Within the *MOQ Values Matter* framework, these patterns are treated as:
- **descriptive**, not prescriptive
- **functional**, not moralized
- **structural**, not theological

They are included because they represent **stable failure modes** that emerge when value hierarchies lose balance, constraint, or cross-level coherence.

This section belongs to the **Value Atlas** and follows the same analytical discipline as all other atlas entries.

## Why “Seven Deadly Sins”

The term *Seven Deadly Sins* is retained deliberately:

- to preserve historical continuity  
- to acknowledge the cultural weight of these patterns  
- to contrast traditional moral framing with MOQ-based analysis  

Religious traditions identified these patterns empirically, long before they could be analyzed structurally.  
The MOQ framework allows us to examine **why these patterns persist**, **how they function**, and **under what conditions they become systemically destructive**.

No moral condemnation is implied by inclusion.

## Analytical Frame

Each entry in this section is analyzed as a **value pattern** using the Canonical Value Atlas structure:

- Neutral definition  
- Multi-level evaluation (Physical / Biological / Social / Intellectual)  
- Cross-level coherence analysis  
- Relational impact mapping  
- Persistence logic  
- Empirical grounding  
- MOQ coherence verdict  

Dynamic Quality is **not operationalized** or scored.  
The focus is on **static pattern behavior, dominance, and failure modes**.

## The Seven Patterns

These seven patterns are not identical in type.  
Each represents a **distinct mode of value dominance or overload** that becomes destructive when left unconstrained:

- **Pride** — hierarchy capture through status and identity  
- **Greed** — entitlement asymmetry through resource capture  
- **Wrath** — norm assertion through force without calibration  
- **Envy** — comparative valuation distortion through zero-sum framing  
- **Lust** — temporal gratification dominance through immediacy  
- **Sloth** — biological conservation refusing upward yield  
- **Gluttony** — capacity overload through unrestrained consumption  

They do not all operate at the same MOQ level, nor do they fail in the same way.

---

## Structural Note on Interpretation

These patterns are:
- **not opposites of virtues**
- **not reducible to personal flaws**
- **not eliminable**

They are best understood as **lower-level or high-energy patterns that become destructive when they refuse constraint, integration, or dominance transfer to higher levels**.

Later sections may introduce:
- constraint patterns
- stabilizing counter-patterns
- structural clusters
- comparative analyses

None of those are asserted here.

## Canon Status

This section index is **not Canon**.

All seven individual entries listed below have been **promoted to Canon** following full Canon Review and revision.

The index page remains structural and may evolve as:
- relationships between patterns are refined
- clusters or counter-patterns are introduced
- cross-domain applications are added
