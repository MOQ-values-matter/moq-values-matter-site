## Purpose of Canon Clusters

Canon clusters are **structural reference pages** that organize and relate **already-Canon value patterns**.

They exist to:
- clarify how Canon patterns interact
- stabilize cross-pattern relationships
- prevent conceptual drift or accidental reduction
- provide navigational and explanatory structure **within the Value Atlas**

Clusters do **not** define new values, laws, or patterns.  
They **do not compete** with individual Value Atlas entries or the Fundamental Laws.

Clusters are **maps**, not terrain.

---

## What a Canon Cluster Is

A Canon cluster:
- relates two or more **existing Canon Value Atlas entries**
- explains their **functional roles, dependencies, or tensions**
- preserves MOQ level boundaries
- introduces **no new evaluative content**
- does not revise the meaning of any linked entry

Clusters are authoritative only insofar as they **accurately reflect existing Canon entries**.

---

## What a Canon Cluster Is Not

A Canon cluster is **not**:
- an essay or article
- an interpretive lens
- a new framework
- a proposal or hypothesis
- a replacement for individual Value Atlas entries
- a place for persuasion, synthesis beyond Canon, or rhetoric

If a page introduces a new idea, it does **not** belong here.

## Relationship to Other Canon Structures

| Structure | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Fundamental Laws | Define invariant constraints across MOQ levels |
| Value Atlas Entries | Define and analyze individual value patterns |
| **Canon Clusters** | Organize structural relationships among Canon Value Atlas entries |
| Essays | Explore, test, or challenge Canon (non-binding) |

Canon clusters exist **inside the Value Atlas** as relational overlays.  
They do **not** form a separate theoretical layer and do **not** sit between laws and values.

---

## Canon Discipline (Mandatory)

All Canon clusters must:
- reference **only Canon Value Atlas entries**
- preserve original definitions verbatim
- avoid moralizing language
- avoid intellectual overreach
- avoid Dynamic Quality formalization
- remain stable unless referenced Canon entries themselves change

If a Canon entry changes, clusters may be updated **only to restore accuracy**, not to reinterpret meaning.

---

## Current Canon Clusters

- **Myth–Integrity–Deception–Truth**  
  A social–intellectual cluster explaining how meaning binding, agency, distortion, and correction interact in human systems.

- **Cardinal Virtues — Structural Integration**  
  A structural cluster describing how temperance, courage, prudence, and justice function as a stability envelope for social scaling.

(Additional clusters may be added as the Value Atlas grows.)

---

## When a New Canon Cluster Is Justified

A new Canon cluster is justified **only** when existing Canon Value Atlas entries exhibit a **stable, recurring structural relationship** that cannot be clearly expressed through individual entries or cross-links alone.

A cluster may be created **only if all conditions below are met**.

---

### Mandatory Criteria (All Required)

A proposed Canon cluster MUST:

1. **Reference two or more existing Canon Value Atlas entries**
   - No Draft or exploratory entries may be clustered.
   - A cluster cannot be used to promote Draft content implicitly.

2. **Describe relationships, not new patterns**
   - The cluster may organize, compare, or relate Canon entries.
   - It must not define, rename, or reinterpret any value pattern.

3. **Resolve structural ambiguity**
   - The relationship must be:
     - recurrent,
     - non-trivial,
     - and necessary for correct understanding.
   - If simple cross-linking is sufficient, a cluster is not justified.

4. **Preserve MOQ hierarchy and boundaries**
   - No cluster may collapse MOQ levels.
   - No intellectual values may be smuggled into social patterns.
   - No moral elevation or demotion of patterns is permitted.

5. **Introduce zero new evaluative claims**
   - Every claim must be directly traceable to existing Canon entries.
   - Any sentence not defensible by reference to Canon is forbidden.

---

### Common Valid Reasons for a Cluster

A Canon cluster is typically justified when:
- a **set of patterns forms a stable configuration** (e.g. dependency, cycle, envelope)
- misunderstanding the relationship leads to **systematic analytical errors**
- the patterns are repeatedly invoked together
- the interaction explains **system stability or failure modes** better than isolated entries

---

### Invalid Reasons for a Cluster

A Canon cluster must NOT be created because:
- patterns are thematically similar
- the grouping feels elegant or persuasive
- it is pedagogically convenient
- it advances a normative or ideological position
- it replaces the need to read individual entries

Clusters exist to **clarify structure**, not to simplify thought.

---

### Cluster Review Standard

Before designation as Canon, a proposed cluster must be reviewed to confirm:
- no new claims are introduced
- all relationships are explicitly traceable to Canon entries
- removal of the cluster would materially reduce structural clarity
- MOQ hierarchy remains intact throughout

---

## Canon Status

Cluster pages are Canon by designation when they:
- reference only Canon Value Atlas entries
- introduce no new claims
- preserve hierarchy and boundaries
- pass structural review

## Canon Declaration

> **Canon Declaration:**  
> This index defines the role and constraints of Canon clusters **within the Value Atlas** of the MOQ Values Matter repository and is designated **Canon** as structural governance content.
