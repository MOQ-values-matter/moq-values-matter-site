## Cluster Purpose

This cluster clarifies the **structural relationship and boundaries** between three Canon value patterns:

- **Aggression** (biological)
- **Force** (physical)
- **Coercion** (social)

These patterns are frequently conflated in discourse and practice.  
This cluster exists to **prevent level collapse**, **preserve MOQ directionality**, and **stabilize interpretation** across contexts.

No new value patterns or evaluative claims are introduced.

## Canon Entries Referenced

- **Aggression (VA-AGGR-01)** — Biological arousal-based readiness for forceful action  
- **Force (VA-FORC-01)** — Physical capacity-altering execution  
- **Coercion (VA-COER-01)** — Social coordination through threat-backed compliance  

Each entry retains its own Canon definition, scope, and failure modes.

## Primary Level Alignment

| Pattern | Primary MOQ Level | Core Function |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| Aggression | Biological | Mobilization and readiness |
| Force | Physical | Capacity alteration |
| Coercion | Social | Compliance under threat |

No pattern shares a primary level with another.

---

## Directionality and Escalation Order

The three patterns form a **directionally ordered interaction sequence**, not a hierarchy of importance.

### Typical escalation under coordination failure:

1. **Aggression**  
   - Biological activation increases readiness for conflict  
   - May be suppressed, redirected, or discharged without escalation

2. **Coercion**  
   - Social systems impose threat-backed pressure to achieve compliance  
   - Behavior aligns without internal agreement

3. **Force**  
   - Physical execution alters capacity when coercion fails or is insufficient  
   - Operates regardless of compliance or agreement

This sequence reflects **functional progression**, not moral justification.

---

## Pattern Independence

Each pattern can occur **without** the others:

- Aggression can exist without force or coercion  
- Force can occur without aggression or coercion  
- Coercion can operate without immediate force or aggression  

Interaction does not imply reduction or subsumption.

---

## Boundary Conditions

### Aggression Is Not
- physical execution (Force)
- threat-based enforcement (Coercion)
- strategy, policy, or justification

### Force Is Not
- biological arousal (Aggression)
- threat or pressure (Coercion)
- legitimacy or authority

### Coercion Is Not
- physical execution (Force)
- biological readiness (Aggression)
- moral wrongdoing or ideology

These boundary rejections are defined **within each Canon entry** and are reiterated here only for structural clarity.

---

## Failure Mode Alignment

| Pattern | Characteristic Failure |
|------|------------------------|
| Aggression | Chronic activation, misdirected arousal |
| Force | Escalatory counter-force, structural damage |
| Coercion | Resistance accumulation, trust collapse |

Failure modes are **pattern-specific** and do not substitute for one another.

## Diagram: Aggression ↔ Coercion ↔ Force

<img
  src="/assets/diagrams/aggression-coercion-force.svg"
  alt="Diagram showing aggression as internal biological activation, coercion as threat-backed social pressure, and force as physical capacity alteration, with clear MOQ level separation."

### Diagram Interpretation Constraints

- The diagram uses **existing Canon diagram language only**
- **Aggression** is shown as internal activation within a value node  
- **Coercion** is shown as directed social pressure between nodes  
- **Force** is shown as capacity-altering physical interaction  
- Directionality reflects **functional escalation**, not justification

**Prohibitions:**
- Dynamic Quality is not represented
- No moral authority, inevitability, or legitimacy is implied
- No collapse of patterns into a single process is permitted

The diagram is illustrative only and subordinate to Canon text.

---

## Cluster Function

This cluster exists to:

- prevent biological reduction of social enforcement
- prevent social moralization of physical execution
- prevent strategic or ideological redefinition of biological readiness
- preserve clean MOQ level separation in analysis and application

The cluster introduces **no new analytical content** beyond cross-referencing and boundary alignment.

## Canon Cluster Declaration

> **Canon Cluster Declaration:**  
>  
> This cluster page is designated **Canon** as a structural reference organizing relationships between existing Canon value patterns.  
>  
> It introduces no new value claims, preserves MOQ hierarchy, and exists solely to reduce ambiguity and prevent level collapse across Aggression, Force, and Coercion.
