## 1. Neutral Definition

Provide a concise, non-normative description of the value pattern.

This section should describe *what the pattern is*, how it typically manifests, and how it can be distinguished from adjacent or similar patterns.

- No moral judgment
- No prescriptions
- No advocacy
- Observable characteristics only

---

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

Assess the functional contribution of the pattern at each MOQ level.

**Scoring scale**
- 0 = No meaningful contribution or net negative
- 1 = Conditional or mixed contribution
- 2 = Strong, stabilizing contribution

### Physical — <0 | 1 | 2>
Brief justification.

### Biological — <0 | 1 | 2>
Brief justification.

### Social — <0 | 1 | 2>
Brief justification.

### Intellectual — <0 | 1 | 2>
Brief justification.

---

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Analyze how the pattern interacts across MOQ levels.

Address explicitly:
- Which level(s) the pattern primarily serves
- Where it generates cross-level resonance
- Where it introduces tension or suppression
- Conditions under which coherence strengthens or degrades

This section explains *how* value is generated or lost across levels.

---

## 4. Relational Impact Map

Describe how the pattern affects different relational positions.

### Allies
How those aligned with the pattern are affected.

### Neutrals
How observers or indirectly involved parties experience the pattern.

### Adversaries
How those opposed to or threatened by the pattern are affected.

### Internal POV Group
How the pattern shapes incentives, perception, and behavior for those operating within it.

---

## 5. Persistence Logic

Explain why this pattern persists across time, cultures, or systems.

Possible drivers include:
- Evolutionary
- Biological
- Social
- Cognitive
- Institutional
- Technological

Identify:
- Reinforcing mechanisms
- Stabilizing feedback loops
- Conditions under which persistence weakens or collapses

Persistence does not imply legitimacy.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Ground the analysis in observable reality.

Reference relevant evidence from domains such as:
- Anthropology
- Psychology
- Sociology
- History
- Behavioral economics
- Biology
- Political science
- Contemporary institutions

Evidence may be qualitative or quantitative.
Speculative claims must be clearly marked.

---

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Provide a synthesized functional judgment of the pattern.

Address explicitly:
- Overall coherence across MOQ levels
- Primary alignment or conflict zones
- Relationship to Dynamic Quality (facilitative or suppressive)
- Conditions under which the pattern becomes:
  - High-value
  - Low-value
  - Degenerative

This is the only evaluative section.

---

## 8. Summary Schema

Provide a compact, standardized summary for cross-atlas comparison.

- Primary MOQ level:
- Typical score profile:
- Coherence type: <resonant | mixed | conflicting>
- Persistence drivers:
- Common failure mode:
- Related patterns: (internal links)
