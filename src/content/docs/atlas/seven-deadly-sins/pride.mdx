## 1. Neutral Definition

**Pride** is the value pattern in which an individual or group asserts elevated worth and seeks recognition of that worth within a shared evaluative framework. It functions as a **social amplifier of self-valuation**, anchoring dignity, status, and identity relative to others.

Pride is inherently **relational**. It presupposes:
- comparison (higher / lower, better / worse)
- an audience (real or imagined)
- shared criteria of value

Pride manifests through:
- assertion of dignity or honor  
- identification with excellence, role, or achievement  
- refusal to accept humiliation or status loss  
- elevation of self or group narratives  
- protection of identity against perceived devaluation  

Pride does not determine *what* is valued; it intensifies and defends whatever value commitments it attaches to.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0
No evaluative agency or self-concept exists at the physical level.

### Biological — 1
Contributes motivational energy through dominance signaling, deterrence, and competitive drive, but does not constitute pride without social interpretation.

### Social — 2
Acts as a powerful dignity- and status-regulating mechanism that can stabilize roles, responsibility, and collective identity.

### Intellectual — 0
Does not originate from intellectual-level values and frequently interferes with correction, abstraction, and symmetry.

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Pride is **primarily a social value pattern**. It emerges where shared narratives, status hierarchies, and evaluative standards exist. Biological dominance signals may energize pride, but pride only exists once meaning and recognition are socially mediated.

Cross-level dynamics:

- **Biological → Social**  
  Biological drives supply intensity and persistence, but social interpretation determines whether dominance becomes pride, dignity, or honor.

- **Social (core)**  
  Pride stabilizes identity, motivates excellence, and reinforces responsibility *when constrained by accountability and role alignment*.

- **Social → Intellectual tension**  
  Pride frequently weakens intellectual coherence by binding identity to belief, status, or narrative rather than to principle or evidence.

A defining risk of pride is **boundary asymmetry**: constraints, rules, or truths are acknowledged in general but treated as *less applicable* to oneself or one’s group.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies
- Experience reinforced dignity and shared identity.
- Increased cohesion and motivation.
- Risk collective blind spots when pride suppresses internal correction.

### Neutrals
- Interpret pride variably as confidence, legitimacy, or arrogance.
- Often rely on social cues rather than evidence when evaluating claims.

### Adversaries
- Experience pride as exclusionary or contemptuous.
- Heightened probability of escalation, rivalry, or symbolic conflict.

### Internal POV Group
- Elevated sensitivity to status threat and humiliation.
- Strong incentive to defend identity, reputation, or narrative.
- Increased likelihood of rationalization over correction when challenged.

## 5. Persistence Logic

Pride persists due to layered reinforcement:

- **Biological:** motivational energy, deterrence, competitive persistence  
- **Psychological:** protection against shame, loss of agency, or identity collapse  
- **Social:** stabilization of honor systems, leadership legitimacy, and group cohesion  
- **Narrative (Mythic):** reinforcement through stories of specialness, destiny, or chosenness  
- **Historical:** enables collective ambition and ascent, while amplifying collapse when uncorrected  

Persistence does not imply functional optimality across levels.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Pride is consistently observed across:

- anthropology (honor cultures, face systems)
- sociology (status hierarchies, reputation economies)
- psychology (self-enhancement bias, ego defense, identity fusion)
- history (cycles of civilizational rise and hubris-driven decline)

Empirical patterns show recurring **local adaptive benefits** paired with **long-term systemic risk** when correction mechanisms are suppressed.

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Pride is a **high-gain social value amplifier**. Its coherence depends not on its presence but on its **position within the value hierarchy**.

- **High coherence:**  
  Pride is constrained by accountability, symmetry, and responsibility, reinforcing dignity and excellence.

- **Low coherence:**  
  Pride captures the hierarchy, weakens intellectual correction, and introduces selective rule exemption.

- **Primary failure mode:**  
  Boundary relativism combined with resistance to correction.

Pride is uniquely dangerous not because it is extreme, but because it can **legitimize its own exemption from constraint**.
