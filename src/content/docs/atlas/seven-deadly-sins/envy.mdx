## 1. Neutral Definition

**Envy** is the value pattern in which an individual or group evaluates its own position negatively **in relation to the perceived advantage of others**, independent of absolute sufficiency or wrongdoing. It functions as a **comparative valuation distortion**, shifting focus from contribution or coherence to relative position.

Envy is not desire, grievance, or moral protest.  
It is characterized by:
- fixation on relative advantage rather than absolute condition  
- negative valuation triggered by others’ success or status  
- pressure toward leveling, reduction, or delegitimization  
- diminished concern for total system output or excellence  
- reorientation of evaluation from “is this good?” to “why do they have more than me?”  

Envy arises only where **comparison is socially meaningful**.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — **0**
No evaluative comparison or self–other distinction exists at the physical level.

### Biological — **1**
Competitive affect and status sensitivity energize envy, but do not constitute it without social meaning.

### Social — **2**
Core domain of envy; operates through visibility, comparison, legitimacy, and shared evaluative metrics.

### Intellectual — **0**
Does not originate from intellectual-level values and frequently distorts reasoning through suspicion, motive attribution, and zero-sum framing.

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Envy is **primarily a social value pattern** dependent on shared evaluation systems and visible differentiation. Biological competition supplies emotional energy, but envy only emerges when advantage is *symbolically recognized* and socially salient.

Cross-level dynamics:

- **Biological → Social**  
  Competitive instincts provide intensity, but social comparison determines targets and meaning.

- **Social (core)**  
  Envy reframes success as threat and difference as injustice, redirecting attention from contribution to relative position.

- **Social → Intellectual distortion**  
  Envy undermines intellectual coherence by privileging suspicion and grievance over proportionality, evidence, and system-wide outcomes.

A defining feature of envy is **zero-sum valuation**: improvement for others is experienced as loss for the self, regardless of actual impact.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies
- Shared envy can temporarily bond groups through common opposition.
- Cohesion is fragile and dependent on continued targeting.
- High risk of fragmentation once internal differences emerge.

### Neutrals
- Experience pressure to justify their position or disavow advantage.
- Often become targets if perceived as insufficiently aligned.

### Adversaries
- Are delegitimized as undeserving, corrupt, or illegitimate.
- Increased likelihood of symbolic attack, exclusion, or punitive action.

### Internal POV Group
- Heightened sensitivity to comparison cues.
- Incentives shift from contribution to leveling.
- Reduced tolerance for excellence, differentiation, or asymmetry.

## 5. Persistence Logic

Envy persists due to structural features of social systems:

- **Biological:** competitive sensitivity to rank and access  
- **Psychological:** threat to self-worth through unfavorable comparison  
- **Social:** visibility of differentiation, reputational economies  
- **Cultural:** narratives emphasizing relative status over absolute sufficiency  
- **Structural:** comparison persists even in equalized systems once symbolic differences appear  

Envy does not require inequality.  
It persists wherever **comparison remains possible**.

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Envy-related dynamics are documented across domains:

- **Psychology:** social comparison effects, resentment, status anxiety  
- **Sociology:** intra-group rivalry, leveling norms, excellence suppression  
- **Anthropology:** envy-avoidance rituals, witchcraft accusations  
- **Economics:** redistributive pressure driven by relative positioning  
- **History:** purges, factional conflicts, anti-elite movements  

Empirical patterns consistently show:
- short-term mobilization and cohesion  
- long-term erosion of trust, excellence, and system output

---

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Envy is a **social comparative distortion pattern** whose coherence depends on constraint by higher-order coordination principles.

- **High coherence:**  
  Comparative awareness is subordinated to contribution, reciprocity, and system-wide benefit.

- **Low coherence:**  
  Relative position becomes the primary evaluative axis, overriding excellence and cooperation.

- **Primary failure mode:**  
  Zero-sum valuation combined with suppression of differentiation.

**Canon lock:**  
Envy evaluates value by relative position rather than by contribution or coherence.

Envy destabilizes systems not by scarcity, but by **turning difference itself into a loss condition**.
