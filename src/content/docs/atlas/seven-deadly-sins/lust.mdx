## 1. Neutral Definition

**Lust** is the value pattern in which immediate gratification is prioritized over the preservation of future value, stability, or goal continuity. It functions as a **biologically reinforced temporal distortion**, redirecting attention, motivation, and energy toward high-reward, low-latency stimulation.

Sexual desire is the most visible expression of lust, but not its full scope.  
Lust operates wherever **pleasure is detached from duration, responsibility, or integration**.

Lust is characterized by:
- prioritization of immediate reward  
- low tolerance for delay or restraint  
- repetition and escalation through novelty  
- diversion of time and attention from longer-horizon goals  
- reduced sensitivity to opportunity cost and future impact  

Lust is not sexuality, enjoyment, or attraction.  
It is **gratification decoupled from temporal and structural constraint**.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0
No agency or valuation exists at the physical level.

### Biological — 2
Engages powerful reward and reinforcement systems optimized for rapid pleasure and repetition.

### Social — 1
Can be integrated into stable relational and institutional structures, but destabilizes trust, reliability, and continuity when dominant.

### Intellectual — 0
Does not originate from intellectual-level values and frequently suppresses planning, prioritization, and abstraction through impulse dominance.

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Lust is **primarily a biological value pattern** whose defining feature is **temporal compression**: value is extracted now at the expense of value that must persist later.

Cross-level dynamics:

- **Biological (core)**  
  Lust activates reward circuitry that favors immediacy, novelty, and repetition. Utility is experienced instantly; cost is delayed or abstract.

- **Biological → Social interference**  
  Social systems rely on continuity, trust, and role fulfillment across time. When lust dominates, it diverts energy from these stabilizing patterns toward transient satisfaction.

- **Biological → Goal interference**  
  Lust competes directly with industrious, aspirational, and discipline-dependent patterns by collapsing time horizons and fragmenting attention.

- **Biological → Intellectual suppression**  
  Lust biases cognition toward justification of gratification, reducing foresight, proportional evaluation, and opportunity-cost awareness.

Lust does not negate higher values; it **outcompetes them temporally**.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies
- Short-term alignment through shared stimulation or indulgence.
- Low durability once gratification declines.
- Increased rivalry and disengagement over time.

### Neutrals
- Experience indirect effects through reduced reliability, distraction spillover, and weakened collective focus.
- May adapt norms downward to accommodate diminished continuity.

### Adversaries
- Emerge through competition, exclusivity violations, or perceived boundary crossing.
- Lust-driven behavior often produces secondary conflict beyond its original context.

### Internal POV Group
- Elevated impulse prioritization.
- Reduced investment in long-term goals or commitments.
- Increased rationalization of distraction and deferral.

## 5. Persistence Logic

Lust persists wherever reward precedes consequence:

- **Biological:** dopamine and endorphin reinforcement, novelty bias  
- **Psychological:** stress relief, escapism, validation through stimulation  
- **Social:** commodification of desire, permissive stimulation norms  
- **Technological:** high-intensity, low-friction reward environments  
- **Structural:** systems optimized for engagement rather than integration  

Lust is not culturally specific.  
It emerges wherever **high reward is available without immediate cost**.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Lust-related dynamics are documented across domains:

- **Biology:** reward circuitry activation, novelty escalation  
- **Psychology:** impulse dominance, delayed-gratification failure  
- **Sociology:** trust erosion, productivity loss, norm drift  
- **Media studies:** attention capture, stimulation saturation  
- **History:** cycles of indulgence followed by re-stabilization efforts  

Empirical patterns consistently show:
- strong short-term satisfaction  
- long-term erosion of continuity, focus, and reliability when dominant

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Lust is a **biologically powerful temporal distortion pattern** whose coherence depends on subordination to values that preserve continuity across time.

- **High coherence:**  
  Gratification is integrated within structures that protect future value and goal persistence.

- **Low coherence:**  
  Immediate reward dominates valuation, diverting energy from relational, productive, and aspirational patterns.

- **Primary failure mode:**  
  Collapse of time horizon through repeated prioritization of immediacy.

**Canon lock:**  
Lust prioritizes immediate gratification over the preservation of future value.

Lust destabilizes systems not by pleasure itself, but by **consuming the time and attention required for what must endure**.

**Current status:** Canon

### Revision History
- 2026-01-08 — Initial draft  
- 2026-01-08 — Canon correction: lust reframed as temporal gratification dominance; sexual expression treated as vector rather than definition; persistence generalized; Canon lock added.
- 2026-01-08 — Promoted to Canon following Canon Review.
