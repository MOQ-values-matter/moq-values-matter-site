## 1. Neutral Definition

**Sloth** is the value pattern in which an individual persistently avoids exertion, effort, initiative, or responsibility, favoring rest, passivity, comfort, and risk minimization even when engagement would generate higher value.

Sloth is fundamentally a **biological energy-conservation pattern**.  
It expresses itself as non-engagement, delayed action, or refusal to mobilize.

Sloth is not merely laziness or fatigue.  
It is a **systemic preference for inactivity** rooted in evolutionary efficiency.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0
No agency or valuation exists at the physical level.

### Biological — 2
Highly adaptive survival strategy: conserves energy, minimizes risk, and prevents unnecessary expenditure.

### Social — 0
Provides no stabilizing contribution to cooperation, duty, or role fulfillment once social systems emerge.

### Intellectual — 0
Provides no contribution to learning, truth-seeking, self-correction, or upward development.

> **Canon note:**  
> Scores express **coherence contribution**, not moral judgment.  
> Destructive effects at higher levels are expressed analytically, not numerically.

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis (MoQ Paradox)

Sloth is a **textbook MoQ moral paradox**:  
a pattern that is high-quality at one level and coherence-destroying at higher levels when it refuses to yield dominance upward.

### Biological Level (Core)

At the biological level, sloth is:
- energy-efficient  
- risk-minimizing  
- survival-positive  

Sloth is **fully coherent** within biological constraints.

---

### Social Level (Loss of Coherence)

Once cooperative systems emerge:
- effort must be shared  
- roles must be fulfilled  
- reliability becomes essential  

Sloth withdraws energy from the social layer without compensatory contribution.  
What was biologically adaptive becomes **socially parasitic**.

---

### Intellectual Level (Upward Blockage)

Intellectual patterns require:
- engagement  
- effort  
- curiosity  
- willingness to confront error  

Sloth blocks upward development by refusing mobilization.  
It does not distort truth — it **prevents its pursuit**.

---

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies
- Increased burden and resentment  
- Erosion of trust and cohesion  

### Neutrals
- Perceived unreliability  
- Low cooperation attraction  

### Adversaries
- Interpreted weakness  
- Increased exploitation risk  

### Internal POV Group
- Silent competence decay  
- Morale erosion  
- Stagnation without disruption  

Sloth is destabilizing precisely because it fails **quietly**.

---

## 5. Persistence Logic

Sloth persists because it is:
- biologically efficient  
- psychologically default  
- socially masked  
- culturally reinforced  
- structurally amplified by modern abundance and automation  

Systems often absorb the cost of sloth until collapse forces correction.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

- **Biology:** energy conservation as universal adaptive strategy  
- **Psychology:** effort aversion, procrastination, learned helplessness  
- **Sociology:** free-rider problems, social loafing, bureaucratic inertia  
- **History:** complacency preceding institutional decline  
- **Modernity:** disengagement, sedentary lifestyles, attention collapse  

---

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Sloth is a **high-coherence biological conservation pattern** that undermines social and intellectual value systems when it continues to dominate after higher levels emerge.

**Canon lock:**  
Sloth is the refusal of a biologically adaptive conservation pattern to yield dominance to higher-level responsibilities.

Sloth is not a moral failure.  
It is **misplaced dominance across levels**.
