title: Value Atlas
description: The Value Atlas defines and analyzes individual value patterns in MOQ, and provides structural cluster overlays for navigation and coherence.
status: Draft
---

## Purpose

The Value Atlas is the repository layer that defines **individual value patterns** using the Canon Value Atlas structure.

It is distinct from:
- **Fundamentals** (ontology and laws)
- **Clusters** (structural relationship maps over Canon entries)

---

## What Lives Here

### Value Atlas entries
Each value pattern is defined and analyzed as a standalone entry.

### Clusters
Clusters organize relationships among already-defined Canon entries and introduce no new claims.

---

## How to Use the Atlas

- Start with a value entry if you are analyzing a specific pattern.
- Start with a cluster if you need structural context across multiple patterns.
