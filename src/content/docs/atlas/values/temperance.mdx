## 1. Neutral Definition

**Temperance** is the value pattern by which individuals and groups **regulate intensity, impulse, and consumption through socially internalized restraint**, maintaining coordination stability across time, relationships, and scale.

It is not the suppression of desire, nor mere physiological balance.  
Temperance is the **social regulation of biological impulse** in service of durable coordination.

Temperance manifests as:
- moderation of appetite, aggression, and desire
- delayed gratification despite immediate incentive
- restraint of escalation (revenge, excess, domination)
- stable participation in shared norms
- capacity-aware use of resources
- predictable long-term behavior

Temperance is learned, reinforced, rewarded, and sanctioned socially.  
Biology supplies the drives; **society internalizes restraint**.

Temperance is distinguishable from:
- **biological homeostasis** (automatic regulation without normative learning)
- **suppression** (denial rather than modulation)
- **ascetic signaling** (restraint used for status display)
- **intellectual prudence** (deliberative judgment rather than impulse containment)

Temperance is a **social coordination regulation pattern**, not a private virtue or moral ideal.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0  
Physical systems do not regulate intensity through restraint; temperance requires agency and normative feedback.

### Biological — 1  
Temperance conditionally stabilizes biological systems by limiting overconsumption, exhaustion, and addiction, but is not biologically generated.

### Social — 2  
Temperance stabilizes social coordination by restraining escalation, enabling trust persistence, and supporting long-horizon cooperation at scale.

### Intellectual — 1  
Temperance supports intellectual activity by reducing impulse capture of judgment, but does not generate abstraction, truth, or deliberation.

---

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Temperance originates at the **social level**, where coordination requires restraint of biologically anchored escalation.

Unregulated biological drives tend toward:
- escalation
- retaliation
- dominance cycling
- short-term extraction

Temperance emerges when social systems:
- internalize restraint through norms and institutions
- reward delayed gratification
- sanction impulsive escalation
- encode moderation as reliability rather than weakness

Where temperance is active:
- biological energy is modulated rather than suppressed
- retaliation cycles are interrupted
- loyalty remains durable rather than volatile
- coordination scales beyond kin or immediate reciprocity

Where temperance degrades:
- escalation thresholds lower
- retaliation becomes self-reinforcing
- trust collapses into monitoring and enforcement
- reasoning becomes reactive and post-hoc

Temperance thus functions as a **scaling constraint**, allowing coordination expansion without destabilization.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies

Allied systems tend to experience:
- increased predictability
- reduced escalation risk
- lower enforcement overhead under stress

---

### Neutrals

Neutral observers typically:
- interpret temperance as stability signal
- engage with lower perceived coordination risk
- notice temperance primarily through its absence

---

### Adversaries

Adversarial actors may:
- attempt to provoke escalation
- exploit misinterpretation of restraint as weakness
- lose leverage when restraint remains consistent

Temperance reduces manipulability by limiting impulse capture.

---

### Internal Group Dynamics

Within temperate systems:
- impulse is decoupled from identity
- response thresholds become explicit
- conflict remains containable

When temperance erodes:
- escalation accelerates
- deterrence becomes unstable
- coercion substitutes for restraint
- coordination becomes brittle

---

## 5. Pattern Persistence Logic

Temperance persists because it enables:
- coordination beyond immediate retaliation
- containment of conflict without constant coercion
- institutional durability across generations
- recovery capacity after stress or disruption

Reinforcing mechanisms include:
- reputational reward for restraint
- sanctions against impulsive escalation
- reduced recovery costs after conflict
- increased predictability under provocation

Temperance weakens when:
- escalation is incentivized
- restraint is misread as incapacity
- abundance removes consequence feedback
- outrage cycles are structurally rewarded

Persistence reflects coordination necessity, not moral preference.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Evidence spans multiple domains:

- **Historical:**  
  Greek *sophrosyne*, Stoic civic moderation, Confucian ritual restraint, and legal limits on retaliation consistently appear as stabilizing mechanisms in complex societies.

- **Anthropological:**  
  Cross-cultural sanctions against excess, ritualized moderation, and restraint norms in resource sharing and conflict response.

- **Sociological:**  
  Pluralistic and democratic systems rely on restraint in speech, power use, and retaliation to prevent escalation and fragmentation.

- **Psychological:**  
  Socially learned impulse regulation predicts relationship stability and cooperative persistence more reliably than raw inhibitory capacity.

- **Contemporary:**  
  Polarization, revenge dynamics, and institutional erosion correlate with breakdowns of temperance under incentive misalignment.

These observations converge on temperance as a coordination-stabilizing pattern.

---

## 7. MOQ Coherence Verdict

Temperance is a **social-level coherence-preserving pattern** that restrains biologically anchored escalation and enables large-scale coordination.

It increases coherence when:
- restraint is internalized rather than imposed
- proportional response remains possible
- escalation thresholds are socially legible

It degrades coherence when:
- converted into suppression
- decoupled from response capacity
- enforced without contextual judgment

Temperance does not generate innovation or truth.  
It preserves **conditions under which coordination can persist without collapse**.

## 8. Summary Schema

- **Primary MOQ level:** Social  
- **Typical score profile:** P0 / B1 / S2 / I1  
- **Coherence type:** Scaling-enabling / escalation-limiting  
- **Persistence drivers:** Coordination stability, conflict containment  
- **Common failure mode:** Escalation spirals or repressive overcorrection  
- **Related patterns:** Courage, Prudence, Loyalty, Coercion, Trust

## 9. Explicit Boundary Rejections

This entry does **not** define:
- moral virtue or righteousness
- personality traits
- ascetic ideals
- obedience or passivity

Temperance is not reducible to:
- fear avoidance
- suppression of desire
- intellectual calculation
- lack of capacity for response

These framings obscure temperance’s role as **socially internalized impulse regulation**.

## Canon Declaration

> **Canon Declaration:**  
> This entry has been evaluated against the Canon Promotion Checklist (v1) and is designated **Canon** on the basis of clear social-level primacy, pre-justificatory recognizability, explicit structural failure modes, disciplined boundary rejection, and stable coherence under escalation conditions.  
>  
> Temperance is established as a Canon social-level value pattern within the *MOQ Values Matter* Atlas.
