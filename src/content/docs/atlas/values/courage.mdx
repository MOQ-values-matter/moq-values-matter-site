## 1. Neutral Definition

**Courage** is the value pattern in which individuals or groups **maintain role-aligned action under threat, fear, or sanction**, rather than withdrawing, submitting, or defecting.

The pattern is identified by **continued participation despite elevated personal risk**, not by absence of fear, moral conviction, or belief in success.

Courage requires:

* a socially recognized role or commitment
* the presence of threat, fear, or sanction
* a decision to remain engaged rather than retreat
* tolerance of increased personal cost without immediate withdrawal

Courage is a **social role-stabilization pattern**, not a personality trait, virtue, or emotional state.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0

Physical systems do not experience threat or decide whether to persist under risk.

### Biological — 1

Biological fear and stress responses supply the threat substrate, but unmanaged biological activation alone does not constitute courage.

### Social — 2

Courage is a high-value social pattern that stabilizes roles, norms, and coordination under pressure, intimidation, or sanction.

### Intellectual — 1

Intellectual systems may articulate, justify, or critique courageous action, but do not generate the pattern or determine its occurrence.

**Primary level:** Social

---

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Courage originates at the **social level**, where coordination depends on actors remaining functional under threat.

Biological systems bias toward:

* withdrawal
* submission
* avoidance
* compliance under fear

Courage counterbalances these tendencies when social systems require:

* role continuity under pressure
* enforcement despite backlash
* resistance to intimidation
* maintenance of institutional function

Courage differs structurally from related patterns:

* **Temperance** restrains excess and moderates action.
* **Prudence** evaluates risk and timing.
* **Discipline** regulates behavior over time.

Courage does **not** regulate magnitude or wisdom of action.  
It regulates **whether action persists at all** under threat.

Courage preserves coherence when:

* paired with temperance and prudence
* applied proportionally to role demands
* bounded by replacement capacity

Courage degrades coherence when:

* decoupled from judgment
* normalized as constant exposure
* demanded indiscriminately
* substituted for strategy or planning

Unchecked courage reliably produces depletion.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies (Adjacent or Friendly Circles)

Allied systems experience:

* increased reliability of role performance
* reduced intimidation leverage
* higher confidence in coordination under stress

---

### Neutrals

Neutral observers typically:

* perceive increased stability or resolve
* recalibrate expectations of system resilience
* delay exploitation or opportunistic entry

---

### Adversaries

Adversaries may:

* test whether courage capacity is exhausted
* escalate pressure to induce failure
* experience deterrence when courage proves sustained

Courage alters adversary risk calculation but does not guarantee advantage.

---

### Internal Group Dynamics

Within courageous systems:

* fear is contextualized, not eliminated
* withdrawal thresholds become explicit
* enforcement becomes possible without immediate collapse

When courage erodes:

* intimidation replaces persuasion
* coercion substitutes for legitimacy
* roles hollow out under pressure

---

## 5. Pattern Persistence Logic

Courage persists because:

* social systems face recurring threats
* coordination collapses if all actors withdraw under fear
* enforcement and defense require credible resistance to intimidation

The pattern reappears even when:

* unrewarded
* punished
* strategically costly

Courage weakens or disappears when:

* avoidance is rewarded
* intimidation becomes dominant
* replacement capacity collapses
* courage is demanded continuously rather than situationally

Persistence reflects functional necessity under threat, not virtue.

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Observed recurrence includes:

### Anthropological

- Role-based courage expectations in warrior, guardian, and leadership roles across cultures.
- Initiation and ordeal systems requiring persistence under fear to establish role reliability.

---

### Historical

- Military enforcement and defense requiring sustained action under sanction.
- Institutional collapse following widespread fear compliance.
- Resistance movements maintaining function under repression.

---

### Sociological

- Whistleblowing and enforcement roles depending on willingness to face retaliation.
- Organizations losing coherence when intimidation suppresses role execution.

---

### Psychological

- Fear biases toward withdrawal unless socially overridden.
- Actors maintaining role behavior under threat are perceived as more reliable regardless of outcome.

---

### Contemporary

- Law enforcement, journalism, and regulatory roles requiring action under public or political pressure.
- Institutional decay following sustained intimidation of role-holders.

Across contexts, courage functions as **resistance to intimidation**, not belief in success.

## 7. MOQ Coherence Verdict

Courage is a **social-level coherence-preserving pattern** that maintains role function under threat.

It increases coherence when:

* enabling continued coordination despite fear
* preventing intimidation from becoming dominant
* preserving institutional capacity under pressure

It degrades coherence when:

* detached from prudence or temperance
* normalized as constant exposure
* substituted for planning or judgment

Courage does not generate truth, justice, or novelty.  
It preserves **capacity** for those patterns by preventing collapse under fear.

## 8. Summary Schema

* **Primary MOQ level:** Social
* **Typical score profile:** P0 / B1 / S2 / I1
* **Coherence type:** Threat-resistance / role-stabilizing
* **Persistence drivers:** Intimidation pressure, role continuity needs
* **Common failure mode:** Depletion, recklessness, deterrence collapse
* **Related patterns:** Temperance, Prudence, Loyalty, Integrity, Fear, Coercion

---

## 9. Explicit Boundary Rejections

This entry does **not** define:

* heroism
* bravery as virtue
* fearlessness
* moral superiority
* success or righteousness

Courage is not reducible to:

* confidence
* aggression
* sacrifice
* belief in outcome

These framings obscure courage’s function as **continued role performance under threat**.

## 10. Canon Status & Revision Notes

**Current status:** Canon

### Revision History

* 2026-01-09 — Initial draft  
* 2026-01-16 — Revised to remove valor framing, enforce structural failure modes, clarify relation to temperance and prudence, and tighten social-level primacy  
* 2026-01-16 — Canon Promotion Checklist passed; Canon status declared

## Canon Declaration

> **Canon Declaration:**  
> This entry has been evaluated against the Canon Promotion Checklist (v1) and is designated **Canon** on the basis of clear social-level primacy, pre-justificatory recognizability, explicit structural failure modes, disciplined boundary rejection, and stable coherence under threat conditions.  
>  
> Courage is established as a Canon social-level value pattern within the *MOQ Values Matter* Atlas.
