## 1. Neutral Definition

**Gluttony** is the value pattern in which an individual or group persistently consumes resources, stimulation, or inputs in excess of physiological, cognitive, or systemic processing capacity. It functions as a **consumption overflow pattern**, prioritizing intake over integration.

Gluttony is characterized by:
- repeated intake beyond sufficiency  
- diminished sensitivity to satiety or internal limits  
- escalation of quantity, intensity, or frequency  
- reduced capacity to metabolize, integrate, or reflect  
- displacement of balance by accumulation-through-consumption  

Gluttony is not hunger or enjoyment.  
It is **consumption decoupled from restraint and assimilation**.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0
No agency or consumption intent exists at the physical level.

### Biological — 2
Directly engages metabolic, reward, and satiety systems; biologically powerful and immediately reinforcing.

### Social — 1
Can be normalized or ritualized, but undermines health, reciprocity, and role reliability when persistent.

### Intellectual — 0
Does not originate from intellectual-level values and frequently degrades reflection, prioritization, and meaning integration.

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Gluttony is **primarily a biological value pattern**, rooted in intake, metabolism, and reward reinforcement. Its defining feature is **excess without assimilation**.

Cross-level dynamics:

- **Biological (core)**  
  Gluttony exploits reward and satiety mechanisms, overriding regulatory feedback. Intake becomes self-reinforcing even as utility declines.

- **Biological → Social spillover**  
  Persistent overconsumption affects reliability, health, and participation. Social systems must absorb increased cost and reduced contribution.

- **Biological → Cognitive saturation**  
  Gluttony generalizes beyond food to stimulation, information, and entertainment, saturating attention and reducing integration.

Gluttony overwhelms **capacity**, not merely desire.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies
- Shared excess can temporarily bond groups through indulgence.
- Long-term reliability and capacity decline.
- Increased dependency and reduced resilience.

### Neutrals
- Bear indirect costs through shared systems (health, productivity, attention).
- May adapt norms downward to accommodate lowered capacity.

### Adversaries
- Can exploit weakened resilience and predictability.
- Excess reduces strategic flexibility.

### Internal POV Group
- Immediate negative signaling of poor self-regulation and lack of restraint.
- Elicits disgust, discomfort, or social aversion in shared contexts.
- Degrades mutual regard and perceived character quality.
- Weakens shared norms of moderation and reciprocity.
- Excess becomes a defining trait rather than an isolated behavior.

Gluttony is uniquely destabilizing because it is **performed in plain sight**.  
Unlike greed or envy, it cannot easily be concealed and therefore directly reshapes group perception and cohesion.

## 5. Persistence Logic

Gluttony persists due to strong reinforcement loops:

- **Biological:** caloric surplus bias, reward reinforcement, satiety override  
- **Psychological:** comfort seeking, stress buffering, boredom relief  
- **Social:** abundance signaling, indulgence norms, convenience cultures  
- **Technological:** hyper-available, low-friction consumption environments  
- **Economic:** production systems optimized for throughput over assimilation  

Gluttony persists because **short-term intake rewards precede long-term capacity costs**.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Gluttony-related dynamics appear across domains:

- **Biology:** overeating, metabolic overload, addiction pathways  
- **Psychology:** compulsive consumption, tolerance escalation  
- **Sociology:** public health burden, reduced workforce capacity  
- **Media studies:** information overload, attention saturation  
- **History:** decadence phases preceding institutional fragility  

Empirical patterns show:
- diminishing returns per unit consumed  
- progressive reduction in processing and recovery capacity

---

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Gluttony is a **biologically reinforced overflow pattern** whose danger lies in overwhelming the systems required to sustain value.

- **High coherence:**  
  Consumption remains matched to assimilation capacity and recovery.

- **Low coherence:**  
  Intake escalates beyond integration, degrading health, attention, and reliability.

- **Primary failure mode:**  
  Capacity collapse through sustained overconsumption.

**Canon lock:**  
Gluttony overwhelms a system’s capacity to metabolize what it consumes.

Gluttony does not destroy by scarcity or force.  
It destroys by **exhausting the systems that must integrate value**.

## Canon Status & Revision Notes

**Current status:** Canon

### Revision History
- 2026-01-08 — Initial draft aligned to Seven Deadly Sins reference pattern; gluttony framed as consumption overflow rather than moral excess.
- 2026-01-08 — Canon correction: restraint explicitly integrated; social visibility and group-signaling effects clarified.
- 2026-01-08 — Promoted to Canon following Canon Review.
