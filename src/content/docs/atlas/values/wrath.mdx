## 1. Neutral Definition

**Wrath** is the value pattern in which an individual or group undergoes rapid mobilization of aggressive energy in response to perceived boundary violation, injustice, threat, or intolerable transgression. It functions as a **biological norm-assertion mechanism**, declaring non-negotiability through force or the credible threat of force.

Wrath is characterized by:
- sudden activation of aggression and urgency  
- intense emotional arousal  
- readiness for punishment, retaliation, or termination  
- collapse of restraint in favor of decisive action  
- narrowing of attention toward the perceived violation  

Wrath is not irritation or hostility.  
It is the value-driven declaration: **“this cannot be allowed to continue.”**

Wrath does not determine truth, proportionality, or future order.  
It asserts boundaries before such judgments can occur.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0
No agency or valuation exists at the physical level.

### Biological — 2
Core survival mechanism enabling rapid boundary defense, deterrence, and threat termination.

### Social — 1
Can activate norm enforcement and collective boundary defense, but destabilizes groups unless rapidly constrained and transformed.

### Intellectual — 0
Does not originate from intellectual-level values and systematically suppresses deliberation, correction, and abstraction while active.

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Wrath is **primarily a biological value pattern** whose distinctive feature is **speed without calibration**. It privileges immediacy over accuracy and certainty over nuance.

Cross-level dynamics:

- **Biological (core)**  
  Wrath mobilizes strength, focus, and risk tolerance to halt perceived violations. It is evolutionarily ancient and highly efficient under acute threat.

- **Biological → Social activation**  
  In human systems, wrath is frequently triggered by **social meaning**: betrayal, humiliation, injustice, or norm violation. Wrath thus operates *on* social symbols even though it originates biologically.

- **Social role (conditional)**  
  Wrath can function as a **norm-asserting signal**, marking boundaries as non-negotiable when ordinary regulation fails. This is the basis of culturally recognized forms of “just” or “holy” wrath.

- **Social instability risk**  
  Wrath does not self-limit. If not rapidly subordinated to procedure, judgment, or reconciliation, it escalates into vendetta, collective punishment, or internal fracture.

- **Biological → Intellectual suppression**  
  While active, wrath suppresses intellectual capacities for proportionality, truth assessment, and future planning.

Wrath declares that a boundary exists; it cannot determine how that boundary should be enforced.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies
- Protective wrath can reinforce solidarity under threat.
- Uncontained internal wrath rapidly erodes trust and cohesion.
- High risk of factionalization and leadership collapse.

### Neutrals
- Experience wrath as danger, unpredictability, or loss of control.
- Often become adversaries or withdraw to avoid exposure.

### Adversaries
- Wrath deters aggression and raises the cost of transgression.
- Excessive wrath creates predictability and can be strategically exploited.

### Internal POV Group
- Heightened readiness for confrontation.
- Reduced tolerance for ambiguity, dissent, or delay.
- Strong pressure toward unanimity and punitive action.

## 5. Persistence Logic

Wrath persists across cultures and history because it solves boundary problems **faster than any other pattern**:

- **Biological:** survival defense, kin protection, deterrence  
- **Psychological:** adrenaline-driven clarity, empowerment, action readiness  
- **Social:** emergency enforcement when norms are violated or ignored  
- **Historical:** ignition mechanism for revolts, uprisings, and defensive wars  

Wrath persists not because it is optimal, but because **no other pattern activates as rapidly when limits are breached**.

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Wrath-related dynamics are widely documented:

- **Biology:** fight response, hormonal aggression activation  
- **Psychology:** anger narrows attention, increases certainty, suppresses doubt  
- **Sociology:** riots, retaliation cycles, collective punishment  
- **History:** revolutions driven by outrage; collapses driven by vengeance spirals  

Empirical patterns consistently show:
- high short-term effectiveness in stopping violations  
- high long-term instability when wrath becomes continuous or self-legitimating

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Wrath is a **biologically indispensable norm-asserting force** whose coherence depends entirely on **external constraint and transformation**.

- **High coherence:**  
  Wrath is invoked to mark non-negotiability, then rapidly subordinated to judgment, procedure, or reconciliation.

- **Low coherence:**  
  Wrath becomes continuous, self-justifying, and escalatory.

- **Primary failure mode:**  
  Boundary enforcement without proportionality, truth evaluation, or future orientation.

**Canon lock:**  
Wrath asserts that something must stop, but it has no capacity to determine what should follow.

Wrath redeems only when it yields control.  
Uncontained, it is catastrophic.

**Current status:** Canon

### Revision History
- 2026-01-08 — Initial draft  
- 2026-01-08 — Canon correction: wrath reframed as norm-asserting but non-calibrating force; catastrophic escalation preserved; Canon lock added.
- 2026-01-08 — Promoted to Canon following Canon Review.
