## 1. Neutral Definition

**Truth** is an intellectual value pattern in which representations—models, statements, measurements, or narratives—**correspond sufficiently with reality** to support reliable understanding, prediction, and correction.

Truth is not defined by sincerity, morality, or social approval.  
It is defined by **tracking what constrains action**, regardless of preference.

Truth operates through:
- correspondence with observable reality
- internal coherence and non-contradiction
- evidential grounding
- falsifiability and correction
- reproducibility across observers and contexts

Truth answers the question:
> *Do our representations track reality well enough to avoid systematic error?*

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 1  
Truth is not a physical pattern, but accurate truth-tracking about physical reality (e.g., physics, engineering, medicine) has decisive physical consequences. Systems built on false models fail.

### Biological — 1  
Organisms benefit from sufficiently accurate perception and modeling of their environment. However, partial truth and selective ignorance can be biologically adaptive under some conditions.

### Social — 1  
Truth conditionally supports social coordination, trust, and institutional legitimacy, but often conflicts with social incentives rooted in myth, loyalty, or power preservation.

### Intellectual — 2  
Truth is the central stabilizing value of intellectual patterns. Without truth-seeking, intellectual activity collapses into rhetoric, ideology, or narrative manipulation.

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Truth primarily serves the **intellectual level**, where coherence, correction, and explanation are dominant values.

Cross-level dynamics:
- **Intellectual → Social tension:** Truth destabilizes myths, identities, and power arrangements when correspondence conflicts with meaning or legitimacy.
- **Social dependency:** Truth requires social preconditions—especially **Integrity**—to function reliably at scale.
- **Biological trade-offs:** Complete or continuous truth exposure may increase stress or reduce short-term biological efficiency.

Truth does not generate coordination or meaning by itself.  
It **corrects**, rather than binds.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies  
Among allies, truth:
- enables accurate planning and learning
- reduces long-term coordination failure
- increases trust when combined with integrity

However, untempered truth can destabilize relationships if not mediated by social judgment.

### Neutrals  
For neutrals, truth builds credibility over time. Groups known for truth-seeking attract cooperation, talent, and legitimacy—but only where integrity is already visible.

### Adversaries  
Internally, truth about adversaries is a strategic asset.  
Externally, full truth disclosure may be dangerous.  
This creates a necessary distinction between **epistemic truth** and **informational strategy**.

### Internal POV Group  
Internally, truth:
- exposes dysfunction and error
- enables correction and learning
- undermines comforting self-myths

Without integrity and resilience, internal truth is often experienced as threat rather than asset.

---

## 5. Persistence Logic

Truth persists because systems that track reality more accurately:
- make fewer catastrophic errors
- adapt more effectively
- recover faster from failure
- outperform over long time horizons

Truth is often resisted locally because it:
- threatens status
- destabilizes myth
- exposes power asymmetries
- demands revision

Truth persists not because it is comfortable, but because **reality eventually enforces its constraints**.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Truth-seeking patterns are foundational to:
- empirical science and measurement
- engineering and safety systems
- auditing, accounting, and quality assurance
- judicial fact-finding
- historical reconstruction
- medical diagnostics
- large-scale technological coordination

Historical patterns consistently show that institutions suppressing corrective truth accumulate hidden error until failure becomes unavoidable.

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Truth is an **intellectually indispensable but socially destabilizing pattern**.

- **Primary alignment:** Intellectual coherence and correction
- **Primary conflict:** Myth preservation and deceptive power structures
- **Relationship to Dynamic Quality:** Facilitating — truth allows novel reality introduced by Dynamic Quality to be recognized, integrated, and stabilized

Truth does not create value by comfort or consensus.  
It creates value by **preventing accumulated error**.

## 8. Summary Schema

- **Primary MOQ level:** Intellectual  
- **Typical score profile:** Physical 1 / Biological 1 / Social 1 / Intellectual 2  
- **Coherence type:** Corrective and stabilizing over time  
- **Persistence drivers:** Reality constraint, error correction, adaptive advantage  
- **Common failure mode:** Suppression by myth, power, or psychological fragility  
- **Related patterns:**  
  - **Integrity** — social precondition  
  - **Deception** — opposing social pattern  
  - **Myth (L-S-07)** — social substrate truth disrupts  
  - **Propaganda** — operational truth distortion
