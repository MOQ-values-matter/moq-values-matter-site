## 1. Neutral Definition

**Integrity** is a social value pattern characterized by **consistent correspondence between internal commitment, expressed intention, and enacted behavior**, across situations and over time.

Integrity manifests as:
- reliability of word–action alignment
- predictability under pressure
- resistance to incentive-driven contradiction
- willingness to accept social or material cost to preserve consistency

Integrity does not depend on truth, correctness, or rational justification.  
It is observable and meaningful **within shared myths, roles, and obligations**, independent of intellectual explanation.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0  
Integrity has no direct function at the physical level.

### Biological — 1  
Integrity can indirectly support biological stability by reducing internal stress and signaling reliability, but may incur survival costs in hostile or unstable environments.

### Social — 2  
Integrity is a high-value social pattern. It enables:
- trust
- role stability
- status differentiation
- long-term cooperation
- credible commitment  

Integrity allows social systems to function with reduced enforcement and lower coordination cost.

### Intellectual — 1  
Integrity conditionally supports intellectual activity by stabilizing communication, inquiry, and responsibility, but does not require intellectual coherence or truth-seeking to exist.

---

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Integrity primarily serves **social coherence**.

Cross-level dynamics:
- **Social → Intellectual enablement:** Integrity creates the trust conditions necessary for reliable discourse, inquiry, and abstraction.
- **Intellectual rationalization:** Intellectual systems can explain, formalize, or critique integrity, but do not generate it.
- **Biological tension:** Upholding integrity may increase risk, stress, or vulnerability when deception offers short-term advantage.

Integrity enables higher-level patterns by providing **predictable agency**, not by guaranteeing correctness.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies  
Allies experience reduced uncertainty, increased trust, and lower transaction costs, even when underlying beliefs differ.

### Neutrals  
Neutrals observe integrity as reliability over time, enabling reputation formation and stable expectations.

### Adversaries  
Adversaries may exploit integrity tactically or frame it as rigidity, disloyalty, or weakness under power struggle conditions.

### Internal POV Group  
Actors operating with integrity experience internal consistency and stable identity, often accompanied by increased social cost in deceptive or coercive environments.

## 5. Persistence Logic

Integrity persists because it:
- enables trust without continuous verification
- stabilizes reputation and status
- reduces coordination overhead
- supports long-term cooperation
- allows social roles to remain legible

Integrity weakens when:
- deception is systematically rewarded
- power structures decouple status from reliability
- enforcement replaces trust
- survival depends on narrative compliance

Persistence does not imply dominance under all conditions.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Integrity is observable across:
- honor cultures
- oath-based societies
- kinship and clan systems
- military codes
- professional ethics
- long-term trade and alliance networks

These systems often precede formal intellectual justification and rely on **reputation and consequence**, not explanation.

---

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Integrity is a **socially stabilizing and cross-level enabling pattern**.

- **Primary alignment:** Social trust, predictability, and coordination
- **Primary conflict:** Deceptive power systems and narrative manipulation
- **Relationship to Dynamic Quality:** Facilitative — integrity keeps social patterns permeable to correction by preserving credible agency

Integrity becomes **high-value** where long-term coordination and adaptation matter. It becomes **locally disadvantageous** in environments dominated by deception, coercion, or short-term power optimization.

## 8. Summary Schema

- **Primary MOQ level:** Social  
- **Typical score profile:** Physical 0 / Biological 1 / Social 2 / Intellectual 1  
- **Coherence type:** Enabling and stabilizing  
- **Persistence drivers:** Trust, reputation, role legibility, reduced enforcement cost  
- **Common failure mode:** Erosion under incentive structures rewarding deception  
- **Related patterns:**  
  - **Deception**  
  - **Myth (L-S-07)**  
  - **Propaganda**  
  - **Truth**
