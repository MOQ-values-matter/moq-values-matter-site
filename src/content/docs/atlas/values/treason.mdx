## 1. Neutral Definition

Treason (also treachery) is the value pattern in which a value-bearing individual or sub-structure **withdraws allegiance from one binding social circle and reattaches value flow to another**, contrary to the loyalty expectations of the original circle.

The pattern is identified by **observable reorientation of loyalty and cooperation**, not by motive, belief, truth-claims, or moral evaluation.

Treason requires:

* an established expectation of loyalty
* a competing or successor circle
* a detectable shift in value contribution between circles

Treason is a **social coordination rupture**, not a psychological disposition or ideological stance.

---

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0

Physical systems do not form or recognize loyalty relations.

### Biological — 1

Biological responses (stress, fear, isolation) are activated following social rupture but do not generate the pattern.

### Social — 2

Treason directly disrupts loyalty, trust, reciprocity, and enforcement within social value circles.

### Intellectual — 1

Intellectual frameworks reinterpret treason post hoc, but do not originate recognition of the rupture.

**Primary level:** Social

---

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Treason originates at the **social level**, where loyalty expectations coordinate cooperation and role stability.

When treason occurs:

* social reciprocity breaks
* enforcement mechanisms activate
* exclusion or degradation follows

Biological systems respond downstream through:

* loss of protection
* stress and vulnerability
* increased threat exposure

Intellectual systems respond by:

* reframing the act as betrayal, truth-telling, or necessity
* justifying or condemning the reattachment
* formalizing narratives after the rupture has already occurred

Coherence is maintained when:

* loyalty expectations are clear
* competing circles are bounded
* enforcement is proportional

Coherence degrades when:

* reattachment becomes frequent
* trust collapses into generalized suspicion
* enforcement replaces reciprocity as the dominant mechanism

---

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies (Adjacent or Friendly Circles)

Allied or adjacent circles observing treason elsewhere tend to:

* downgrade trust toward the transferring node
* reassess the reliability of the node’s commitments
* increase caution in forming deep reciprocal ties
* treat prior loyalty claims as provisional rather than binding

Even when allies benefit indirectly from the reattachment, the act signals **transferability of allegiance**, reducing long-term predictability.

---

### Neutrals

Neutral observers typically:

* register increased systemic risk
* delay commitment or affiliation
* shift toward observational rather than participatory engagement

Treason raises perceived coordination cost even for uninvolved actors.

---

### Adversaries / Receiving Circle

The receiving or opposing circle typically:

* gains instrumental value (information, legitimacy, leverage)
* restricts trust toward the transferring node
* limits integration depth or duration
* avoids placing the node in roles requiring high loyalty

The act is utilized but rarely rewarded with full standing.

---

### Internal Group Dynamics (Original and Affected Circles)

Within circles directly impacted by treason:

* loyalty boundaries become explicit
* signaling, surveillance, and enforcement increase
* marginal members experience heightened scrutiny
* coordination costs rise as trust decays

**Net relational effect:**
Treason increases relational asymmetry across the system and reduces generalized trust.

---

## 5. Persistence Logic

Treason persists because:

* social systems compete for allegiance
* individuals and sub-structures face incompatible loyalty demands
* legitimacy differentials emerge between circles

The pattern reappears even when:

* legally prohibited
* morally condemned
* culturally stigmatized

Treason weakens or disappears when:

* loyalty demands are minimal
* circles are non-overlapping
* exit mechanisms exist without reattachment

Persistence reflects structural tension, not endorsement.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Observed recurrence includes:

* **Legal systems:**
  Independent criminalization of treason across cultures, regardless of motive.

* **Sociological observation:**
  Long-term marginalization of defectors and whistleblowers, even when claims are validated.

* **Anthropological cases:**
  Kin-group exclusion following testimony against family or clan members.

* **Mythological patterns:**
  Rebel or betrayer figures punished or exiled after enabling transition.

* **Organizational behavior:**
  Distrust of proven defectors in competitive institutions.

These observations converge on a stable pattern of social response.

---

## 7. MOQ Coherence Verdict

Treason is a **high-impact social-level pattern** that reallocates value between competing circles while degrading trust in the transferring node.

It increases coherence when:

* enabling transition away from exhausted or collapsing structures
* exposing irreconcilable loyalty conflicts

It degrades coherence when:

* normalized as a strategy
* frequent enough to collapse trust
* unbounded by stable receiving structures

Its primary MOQ placement remains **social**.

---

## 8. Summary Schema

* **Primary MOQ level:** Social
* **Typical score profile:** P0 / B1 / S2 / I1
* **Coherence type:** Transitional / destabilizing
* **Persistence drivers:** Competing loyalties, legitimacy gaps, enforcement failure
* **Common failure mode:** Generalized distrust and enforcement escalation
* **Related patterns:** Loyalty, Trust, Integrity, Courage

---

## 9. Explicit Boundary Rejections

This entry does **not** define:

* a moral vice or virtue
* a personality trait
* a truth-evaluation mechanism
* an ideological position
* a legal doctrine

Treason is not reducible to:

* intent
* belief
* correctness of claims
* emotional states

These framings fail to account for the pattern’s **structural recurrence and relational effects**.
