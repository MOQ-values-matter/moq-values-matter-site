## 1. Neutral Definition

**Greed** is the value pattern in which an individual or group persistently seeks to acquire, retain, or control a disproportionate share of resources, benefits, or advantages **by exempting itself from the limits and constraints that apply to the shared system**.

Greed is not ambition, desire, or planning for security.  
It is characterized by:
- entitlement asymmetry (“more for me than for others”)
- accumulation beyond functional sufficiency
- resistance to limitation, redistribution, or reciprocity
- justification of excess through status, merit, or exception claims
- externalization of cost onto others or future states

Greed is inherently **social**: it presupposes shared allocation rules, scarcity conditions, and normative expectations governing fairness and contribution.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0
No agency or valuation exists at the physical level.

### Biological — 1
Provides motivational energy for acquisition and buffering, but does not constitute greed without social entitlement structures.

### Social — 2
Directly shapes allocation systems, incentives, hierarchies, and institutional behavior; core distortion zone.

### Intellectual — 0
Does not originate from intellectual-level values and frequently distorts reasoning through rationalization and selective abstraction.

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Greed is **primarily a social value pattern** rooted in allocation, entitlement, and exemption within shared systems. Biological drives toward security or accumulation supply energy, but greed only emerges where **rules exist that can be selectively bypassed**.

Cross-level dynamics:

- **Biological → Social**  
  Acquisition instincts provide persistence and intensity, but social systems determine whether accumulation remains bounded or becomes asymmetrical.

- **Social (core)**  
  Greed reorganizes incentives so that accumulation is rewarded faster than its systemic consequences are registered. This creates structural blind spots and delayed correction.

- **Social → Intellectual tension**  
  Greed undermines intellectual coherence by incentivizing motivated reasoning, selective modeling, and narratives that normalize exemption from shared limits.

A defining feature of greed is **limit asymmetry**: constraints are recognized as necessary for the system, but treated as optional for the accumulator.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies
- Benefit materially from protected accumulation.
- Reinforced loyalty through shared gain.
- Increased risk of normalization of extraction and denial of downstream harm.

### Neutrals
- Experience reduced access, rising costs, or competitive pressure.
- Often perceive unfairness without clear attribution or leverage.

### Adversaries
- Experience deprivation, exclusion, or exploitation.
- Heightened likelihood of resentment, resistance, or systemic backlash.

### Internal POV Group
- Strong incentive to defend surplus through narratives of merit, efficiency, or inevitability.
- Reduced sensitivity to externalized cost and long-term instability.

## 5. Persistence Logic

Greed persists due to layered reinforcement mechanisms:

- **Biological:** security buffering, loss aversion, dominance through control  
- **Psychological:** fear of loss, identity reinforcement through possession  
- **Social:** reward systems that prioritize accumulation speed over consequence visibility  
- **Institutional:** financialization, incentive capture, regulatory asymmetry  
- **Historical:** accumulation enables expansion and resilience, while excess accelerates inequality and collapse  

Greed persists not because scarcity exists, but because **systems reward extraction before correction activates**.

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Greed-related dynamics are documented across domains:

- anthropology (elite capture, hoarding behavior)
- economics (rent-seeking, monopoly formation, inequality accumulation)
- sociology (class stratification, institutional capture)
- psychology (loss aversion, entitlement bias)
- history (late-stage empire dynamics, oligarchic consolidation)

Empirical patterns consistently show:
- short-term system efficiency gains
- long-term erosion of trust, reciprocity, and stability

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Greed is a **social entitlement distortion pattern** whose coherence depends entirely on the presence and enforcement of shared limits.

- **High coherence:**  
  Accumulation remains bounded by reciprocity, redistribution, and long-term system viability.

- **Low coherence:**  
  Greed captures incentive structures, suppresses corrective feedback, and externalizes cost onto weaker agents or future states.

- **Primary failure mode:**  
  Systematic exemption of the accumulator from shared limits.

Greed becomes destructive not through desire itself, but through **the normalization of unequal constraint application**.

## Canon Status & Revision Notes

**Current status:** Canon

### Revision History
- 2026-01-08 — Initial draft  
- 2026-01-08 — Canon correction: greed reframed as entitlement asymmetry; biological drivers clarified as secondary; core failure mode sharpened.
- 2026-01-08 — Promoted to Canon following Canon Review; designated second reference entry for Seven Deadly Sins.
