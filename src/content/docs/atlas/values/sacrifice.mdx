## 1. Neutral Definition

**Sacrifice** is the value pattern in which a value-bearing individual or collective **voluntarily accepts permanent or irreversible cost**, reallocating value away from its own future options in order to stabilize, enable, or bind a social structure beyond itself.

The pattern is identified by **chosen closure of future possibilities**, not by suffering, endurance, belief, or moral justification.

Sacrifice requires:

* a value-bearing node (individual or group)
* a voluntary acceptance of irreversible or non-recoverable cost
* a redirection of value away from the node’s own future capacity
* a social structure that persists or stabilizes as a result

Sacrifice is a **social value reallocation pattern**, not an emotion, virtue, or narrative act.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0

Physical systems do not choose, allocate, or forfeit future value.

### Biological — 1

Biological systems supply the substrate of cost (injury, death, depletion), but do not generate sacrifice as a value pattern.

### Social — 2

Sacrifice is a high-impact social pattern that reallocates value to bind groups, roles, hierarchies, and collective futures.

### Intellectual — 1

Intellectual systems interpret, justify, ritualize, or condemn sacrifice after the act, but do not originate recognition of the pattern.

**Primary level:** Social

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Sacrifice originates at the **social level**, where coordination and continuity sometimes require value transfer that permanently diminishes the contributing node.

Sacrifice differs structurally from related patterns:

* **Discipline** regulates ongoing behavior without closing futures.
* **Temperance** restrains excess while preserving options.
* **Courage** enables action under threat without requiring irreversible loss.

Sacrifice is distinctive because it **closes futures**.

When sacrifice occurs:

* the sacrificing node permanently reduces its own future capacity
* value is transferred to a social structure that outlives the node
* asymmetry is created between giver and receiver

Biological systems respond downstream through:

* injury, death, depletion, or stress
* altered survival probabilities

Intellectual systems respond downstream by:

* assigning meaning, honor, or condemnation
* embedding the act in myth, ideology, or doctrine
* attempting to justify or limit repetition

Coherence is preserved when:

* sacrifice remains bounded and exceptional
* receiving structures are stable
* sacrifice is not demanded as a default coordination mechanism

Coherence degrades when:

* sacrifice becomes normalized
* depletion exceeds replacement capacity
* elites externalize sacrifice without reciprocity
* meaning substitutes for structural accountability

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Individual → Self (Value Node)

At the node level, sacrifice entails:

* voluntary acceptance of irreversible loss
* devaluation of one’s own future options
* closure of alternative life paths

This self-reallocation is **structural**, not psychological.

---

### Individual → Individual

Between individuals, sacrifice produces:

* asymmetric obligation or leverage
* altered trust and moral accounting
* durable status differentiation

The recipient may benefit even without reciprocity.

---

### Individual → Group

In individual-to-group sacrifice:

* the individual transfers life, status, fertility, or freedom
* the group gains cohesion, legitimacy, deterrence, or endurance
* the individual may be honored, ignored, or abandoned afterward

Group benefit does not require individual survival.

---

### Group → Group

In group-level sacrifice:

* populations, resources, or generations are expended
* value is transferred between competing collectives
* long-term asymmetries are established

Individual meaning is irrelevant to pattern function at this level.

---

## 5. Persistence Logic

Sacrifice persists because:

* some social structures cannot stabilize without irreversible cost
* deterrence and binding sometimes require credibility beyond endurance
* future coordination can be purchased only by present closure

The pattern reappears even when:

* condemned
* mythologized
* rationally opposed

Sacrifice weakens or disappears when:

* coordination can be achieved through trust or reciprocity
* replacement capacity collapses
* sacrifice is exposed as one-sided or exploitative

Persistence reflects structural necessity under certain conditions, not moral endorsement.

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Observed recurrence includes:

### Anthropological

- Kin-group sacrifice, initiation rites, and generational cost transfer across pre-modern societies.
- Ritualized sacrifice functioning to bind groups and stabilize hierarchy independent of individual benefit.

---

### Historical

- Military last stands and founding sacrifices enabling state formation or survival.
- Population losses and irreversible commitments sustaining empires, revolutions, and defensive coalitions.
- Institutional endurance purchased through irreversible human or material cost.

---

### Mythological

- Deity and hero sacrifice narratives recurring across unrelated cultures.
- Mythic framing consistently follows sacrifice events, functioning to stabilize and contain their disruptive effects.
- Narrative explanation appears downstream of the pattern’s social impact.

---

### Sociological

- Martyrdom and sacrifice effects increasing boundary hardening and in-group cohesion.
- Persistence of sacrificial impact even when individuals are later discredited or abandoned.
- Normalization of sacrifice correlating with long-term depletion and coordination fragility.

---

### Psychological

- **Costly signaling effects:**  
  Voluntary acceptance of irreversible personal cost increases perceived commitment and credibility independent of belief alignment.

- **Commitment and sunk-cost dynamics:**  
  Irreversible cost creates path-dependence through closed futures, reducing defection.

- **Deterrence perception:**  
  Willingness to accept irreversible loss reduces perceived coercibility and increases adversary caution.

---

### Contemporary

- **Military and security contexts:**  
  No-retreat doctrines, suicide missions, and last-stand units alter adversary risk calculations disproportionate to tactical value.

- **Institutional whistleblowing:**  
  Actors accepting permanent career, legal, or social loss reshape organizational behavior even when unrewarded.

- **Political protest:**  
  Hunger strikes, self-immolation, and lifelong imprisonment function as irreversible cost signals destabilizing coordination structures.

- **Organizational behavior:**  
  Founders or leaders relinquishing control or status irreversibly can stabilize institutions beyond their own tenure.

Across domains, sacrifice operates **prior to moral agreement and independent of narrative endorsement**.

## 7. MOQ Coherence Verdict

Sacrifice is a **high-impact social-level pattern** that reallocates value by permanently closing futures at one node to stabilize another.

It increases coherence when:

* enabling transition away from exhausted structures
* binding collectives under existential threat
* providing credible deterrence

It degrades coherence when:

* normalized as governance
* disconnected from replacement or reciprocity
* insulated from correction by ideology or myth

Its primary MOQ placement remains **social**.

---

## 8. Summary Schema

* **Primary MOQ level:** Social
* **Typical score profile:** P0 / B1 / S2 / I1
* **Coherence type:** Binding / irreversible
* **Persistence drivers:** Deterrence credibility, structural transition, existential threat
* **Common failure mode:** Depletion, exploitation, civilizational collapse
* **Related patterns:** Courage, Faith, Loyalty, Treason, Coercion

---

## 9. Explicit Boundary Rejections

This entry does **not** define:

* heroism
* altruism
* virtue
* moral obligation
* meaning or belief

Sacrifice is not reducible to:

* suffering
* endurance
* discipline
* narrative justification

These framings obscure sacrifice’s role as **irreversible social value reallocation**.

## Canon Declaration

> **Canon Declaration:**  
> This entry has been evaluated against the Canon Promotion Checklist (v1) and is designated **Canon** on the basis of clear social-level primacy, pre-justificatory recognizability, explicit future-closure criteria, real structural failure modes, cross-domain empirical convergence, and disciplined boundary rejection.  
>  
> Sacrifice is established as a Canon social-level value pattern within the *MOQ Values Matter* Atlas.
