## 1. Neutral Definition

**Sacrifice** is the value pattern in which an individual, role, or sub-structure **absorbs a durable loss of value, protection, or standing in order to stabilize, preserve, or enable a larger social value circle**.

The pattern is identified by **asymmetric cost-bearing**: value loss is concentrated at the node level while value continuity or expansion occurs at the circle level.

Sacrifice is not defined by intent, belief, or moral framing.
It is defined by **observable redistribution of cost and benefit across value levels**.

---

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0

Physical systems do not choose cost-bearing for the sake of larger coordination.

### Biological — 1

Biological systems supply pain, exhaustion, risk, and survival cost, but do not generate sacrificial meaning.

### Social — 2

Sacrifice is a core social mechanism for preserving cohesion, continuity, and legitimacy under stress.

### Intellectual — 1

Intellectual systems interpret, justify, ritualize, or reject sacrifice, but do not originate the pattern.

**Primary level:** Social

---

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Sacrifice originates at the **social level**, where circles must solve coordination problems that exceed individual tolerance for cost.

When sacrifice occurs:

* value loss is localized to specific nodes
* broader structures avoid collapse or fragmentation
* continuity is preserved across time or crisis

Biological systems respond through:

* pain, fear, depletion, or mortality
* heightened stress and vulnerability

Intellectual systems respond through:

* mythic elevation or condemnation
* rationalization as duty, necessity, or error
* post-hoc explanation of meaning or futility

Coherence is preserved when:

* sacrifice is bounded
* the benefiting circle remains legible
* cost-bearing is not endlessly recursive

Coherence degrades when:

* sacrifice becomes mandatory rather than situational
* costs detach from stabilizing effects
* circles externalize sacrifice permanently onto the same nodes

---

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies (Adjacent or Dependent Circles)

Allied circles tend to:

* benefit indirectly from stabilized structures
* interpret sacrifice as signal of commitment or legitimacy
* adjust expectations about future cost distribution

---

### Neutrals

Neutral observers typically:

* register sacrifice as seriousness or resolve
* reassess the durability of the benefiting circle
* remain agnostic about justification while noting cost

---

### Adversaries

Adversaries may:

* exploit sacrificial losses tactically
* test whether sacrifice capacity is exhausted
* reinterpret sacrifice as weakness or desperation
* experience demoralization or deterrence when faced with credible willingness to absorb extreme cost
* reassess risk calculations when opponents signal indifference to loss, injury, or death

Sustained sacrifice can therefore function both as a vulnerability and as a coercive signal, depending on context and adversary perception.

---

### Internal Group Dynamics

Within circles that rely on sacrifice:

* moral narratives intensify
* status distinctions emerge around cost-bearing
* resentment accumulates if sacrifice is uneven or unacknowledged

Sacrifice reshapes internal hierarchies and expectations.

---

## 5. Persistence Logic

Sacrifice persists because:

* some coordination problems cannot be solved by reciprocity alone
* crises concentrate costs faster than they can be distributed
* continuity sometimes requires loss rather than exchange

The pattern reappears even when:

* morally condemned
* economically inefficient
* individually catastrophic

Sacrifice weakens or disappears when:

* systems can distribute cost symmetrically
* exit options replace endurance
* legitimacy of the benefiting circle collapses

Persistence reflects structural necessity, not moral approval.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Observed recurrence includes:

* **Anthropological:**
  Ritual sacrifice, initiation ordeals, scapegoating, and martyr narratives across cultures.

* **Sociological:**
  Soldiers, whistleblowers, caregivers, and expendable labor absorbing cost to preserve institutions.

* **Historical:**
  Sacrificial figures enabling regime survival, revolution, or religious continuity.

* **Organizational:**
  Individuals or departments absorbing blame, layoffs, or risk to protect core functions.

These cases converge on asymmetric cost concentration.

---

## 7. MOQ Coherence Verdict

Sacrifice is a **socially stabilizing but locally destructive pattern**.

It increases coherence when:

* loss at the node level prevents wider collapse
* sacrifice is limited, contextual, and legible

It degrades coherence when:

* sacrifice becomes systemic rather than exceptional
* the same nodes are repeatedly consumed
* narratives obscure the absence of real stabilization

Its primary MOQ placement remains **social**.

---

## 8. Summary Schema

* **Primary MOQ level:** Social
* **Typical score profile:** P0 / B1 / S2 / I1
* **Coherence type:** Stabilizing through asymmetric cost
* **Persistence drivers:** Crisis, legitimacy preservation, coordination limits
* **Common failure mode:** Chronic exploitation or ritualized loss
* **Related patterns:** Courage, Loyalty, Treason, Integrity

---

## 9. Explicit Boundary Rejections

This entry does **not** define:

* moral virtue or vice
* religious doctrine
* altruism or selflessness
* economic efficiency
* metaphysical necessity

Sacrifice is not reducible to:

* belief in higher meaning
* personal nobility
* obedience to authority
* psychological masochism

These framings obscure the structural redistribution of value.
