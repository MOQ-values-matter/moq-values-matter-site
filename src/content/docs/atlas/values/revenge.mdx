## 1. Neutral Definition

**Revenge** is the value pattern by which harm is intentionally returned to an offending agent in order to restore balance, deter future violation, and reaffirm violated boundaries by imposing proportional cost.

Revenge is not identical to cruelty, hatred, or irrationality.
It is a **biologically rooted enforcement response** that becomes deliberate action.

Revenge arises when:
- harm is judged to have created a real value loss or deficit
- redress is absent, ineffective, delayed, or mistrusted
- boundary violation threatens status, safety, or survival
- restoration through reconciliation is unavailable or rejected

Revenge differs from institutional justice:
- **Justice** is formalized, rule-bound, and socially monopolized.
- **Revenge** is decentralized enforcement, typically personal or kin-based, and prone to escalation without constraint.

Revenge restores balance by creating a counter-loss in the offender, returning the value ledger toward equilibrium—often at a negative level.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 1
Revenge requires physical capacity to inflict harm or impose cost.
Its expression is constrained by strength, tools, opportunity, and exposure.

### Biological — 2
Revenge stabilizes at the biological level.
Retaliation deters exploitation, signals enforceable boundaries, and preserves status and safety.
This pattern predates formal morality and legal systems.

### Social — 1
Social systems channel, ritualize, suppress, or monopolize revenge through law, punishment, and enforcement.
Revenge may be legitimized, redirected into institutions, or prohibited as vigilantism depending on social structure.

### Intellectual — 1
Intellect interprets, justifies, restrains, or redirects revenge through narrative, ethics, and legal reasoning.
Intellectual framing can reduce mis-targeting and escalation but rarely removes the underlying enforcement impulse.

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Revenge functions to restore balance after violation by enforcing cost.

Coherence strengthens when:
- retaliation is proportional
- targets are correctly identified
- escalation is limited by recognized boundaries or third-party constraint
- revenge deters repeat harm and reduces future violations

Coherence degrades when:
- retaliation is misdirected or collective
- harm exceeds proportionality
- cycles of counter-revenge dominate
- symbolic narratives replace concrete settlement

Revenge enforces boundaries and deterrence.
It does **not** establish truth, guarantee fairness, or produce impartial correction.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies
Allies experience revenge as protection:
boundary enforcement reassures members that violations carry cost and deters predation.

### Neutrals
Observers interpret revenge as a signal:
it communicates which boundaries are enforced and what consequences follow violation.

### Adversaries
Targets experience imposed cost and deterrence pressure.
Responses may include submission, withdrawal, strategic settlement, or counter-revenge.

### Internal POV Group
Within groups that rely on revenge, incentives favor:
- vigilance and reputational memory
- loyalty enforcement
- rapid response to insult or harm
- risk of escalation dynamics shaping identity and strategy

---

## 5. Persistence Logic

Revenge persists because:
- deterrence requires credible threat
- unchecked exploitation is biologically maladaptive
- memory of harm prevents repeat predation
- revenge substitutes for absent or distrusted enforcement

Reinforcing mechanisms include:
- kinship loyalty and honor obligations
- reputational deterrence
- reciprocal violence norms
- weak or partial institutions

Revenge weakens when:
- trusted enforcement replaces personal retaliation
- reconciliation mechanisms restore balance without counter-harm
- credible third-party arbitration limits escalation

Persistence does not imply moral endorsement.

## 6. Empirical Evidence

### Observed cross-era anchors (descriptive)

- **Retaliatory punishment deterring repeat harm:**  
  *Observation:* credible, proportional retaliation reduces repeated violations in small-scale and weak-institution contexts.  
  *Interpretation:* revenge functions as decentralized deterrent enforcement.

- **Blood feuds in weak-state contexts:**  
  *Observation:* vendettas persist where centralized justice is absent or distrusted.  
  *Interpretation:* revenge substitutes for institutional enforcement through reputational cost.

- **Codified retaliation limiting escalation:**  
  *Observation:* bounded retaliation rules restrict open-ended revenge spirals.  
  *Interpretation:* institutions stabilize revenge by constraining proportionality.

- **Resurgence where trust collapses:**  
  *Observation:* vigilantism increases as institutional legitimacy erodes.  
  *Interpretation:* biological enforcement reasserts itself when social monopolies weaken.

- **Coalition signaling:**  
  *Observation:* groups retaliate to demonstrate commitment and deterrent credibility.  
  *Interpretation:* revenge functions as reputational enforcement.

- **Escalation failure modes:**  
  *Observation:* mis-targeting and collective punishment expand conflict.  
  *Interpretation:* revenge destabilizes systems when proportionality fails.

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Revenge is a **biologically primary enforcement value pattern** that restores balance through deterrent counter-harm.

- When proportional and correctly targeted, revenge stabilizes boundaries and reduces future violations in the absence of trusted institutions.
- When unconstrained, revenge escalates into cycles that destabilize societies and erode cooperation.

Revenge enforces boundaries and deterrence, not truth or fairness.
It is neither virtue nor vice in itself, but a powerful pattern that must be bounded, redirected, or transformed by higher-order systems to avoid escalation.

## Comparative Framing (Explicit)

This entry rejects the following insufficient framings:

- **Moral evil framing:**  
  Revenge is not inherently evil; moral condemnation alone does not explain its persistence or function.

- **Emotional pathology framing:**  
  Revenge is not merely uncontrolled emotion; it is often deliberate and strategically legible.

- **Social failure framing:**  
  Revenge is not simply a breakdown of order; it frequently substitutes for absent or distrusted enforcement.

- **Justice equivalence framing:**  
  Revenge is not identical to justice.

The Canon framing explains **more phenomena with fewer contradictions** by treating revenge as a biologically primary boundary-enforcement value pattern that is later constrained, redirected, or monopolized by social and intellectual systems rather than eliminated by them.
