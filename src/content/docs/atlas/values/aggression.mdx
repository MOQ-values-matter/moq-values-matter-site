## 1. Neutral Definition

**Aggression** is a **biological value pattern** characterized by **heightened physiological arousal and readiness for forceful action** in response to perceived threat, obstruction, or boundary challenge.

The pattern is recognized through **organismic activation states**—such as increased tension, narrowed attention, and action-bias—prior to deliberation, justification, or social meaning.

Aggression is a pattern of **readiness**, not execution, and may or may not result in physical action.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0  
Aggression does not alter physical capacity or constraints by itself.

### Biological — 2  
Aggression originates as a biological mobilization pattern enabling rapid response under perceived threat or competition.

### Social — 1  
Social systems may amplify, suppress, ritualize, or redirect aggression but do not generate its recognition.

### Intellectual — 0  
Intellectual systems may interpret or regulate aggression after activation but do not produce it.

**Primary level:** Biological

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Aggression originates at the **biological level** as a pre-reflective activation pattern preparing the organism for potential conflict or dominance interaction.

This recognition occurs **prior to language, norms, or justification**.

Social systems interact with aggression by:
- suppressing it through norms or sanctions
- redirecting it into ritualized outlets
- amplifying it through signaling or group dynamics

Social structures **do not create aggression**, but they may increase its frequency, duration, or misdirection.

Aggression degrades when:
- activation becomes chronic rather than situational
- arousal is triggered by low-salience or misidentified stimuli
- biological readiness is repeatedly activated without resolution

Aggression remains coherent when:
- activation is proportional
- discharge or resolution occurs
- higher-level containment prevents escalation into indiscriminate action

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies  
Aggression within allied groups may increase short-term mobilization but reduces predictability when activation is frequent or poorly signaled.

### Neutrals  
Aggression is typically interpreted as instability or threat, increasing avoidance and defensive positioning.

### Adversaries  
Aggression increases perceived hostility and raises the likelihood of reciprocal activation or escalation.

### Internal Group Dynamics  
Persistent aggression within groups elevates stress load, degrades coordination, and increases reliance on external constraint.

---

## 5. Persistence Logic

Aggression persists as a value pattern because biological systems repeatedly face conditions involving:
- competition over resources
- boundary intrusion
- status challenge
- immediate threat

The pattern re-emerges even when:
- socially discouraged
- morally condemned
- institutionally suppressed

Aggression weakens or disappears when:
- environmental threat is consistently low
- boundary conditions are stable
- activation costs exceed adaptive benefit

Persistence reflects **biological selection pressure**, not cultural endorsement.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

### Biological  
- Cross-species presence of arousal-based conflict readiness.
- Predictable physiological markers preceding confrontation.

### Ethological  
- Territorial and dominance displays occurring without prior learning or social instruction.

### Anthropological  
- Universality of aggressive responses under threat across cultures.

### Psychological (Descriptive)  
- Elevated stress and activation preceding impulsive or confrontational behavior, independent of moral framing.

These observations demonstrate recurrence without reliance on ideology or justification.

## 7. MOQ Coherence Verdict

Aggression increases MOQ coherence when:
- it enables rapid biological response to genuine threat
- activation is short-lived and resolved
- higher-level patterns constrain escalation

Aggression degrades MOQ coherence when:
- activation becomes chronic
- arousal substitutes for coordination
- biological readiness drives repeated conflict without resolution

Primary level placement remains **biological**.

## 8. Summary Schema

- **Primary MOQ level:** Biological  
- **Typical score profile:** P0 / B2 / S1 / I0  
- **Coherence type:** Arousal-based readiness  
- **Persistence drivers:** Threat perception, competition, boundary challenge  
- **Common failure mode:** Chronic activation, misdirected hostility  
- **Related patterns:** Force (draft), Coercion (Canon), Fear, Dominance

## 9. Explicit Boundary Rejections

This entry does **not** define:

- **Force** — Aggression is readiness, not physical capacity alteration.
- **Coercion** — Aggression does not enforce compliance through threat or sanction.
- **Strategy or policy** — Aggression is not deliberative or planned.
- **Moral authority** — Aggression does not justify action.
- **Social ideology** — Aggression is not produced by belief systems.

Reducing aggression to any of the above collapses biological recognition into higher-level patterns and obscures failure modes.

## 10. Canon Status & Revision Notes

**Current status:** Canon  

### Revision History

- **2026-01-18 — v1.2**  
  Canon Declaration issued following successful Canon Promotion Checklist evaluation.  
  Entry locked at biological primary level with explicit boundary rejections.

- **2026-01-18 — v1.1**  
  Canon-hardening revision: boundary discipline, failure-mode tightening, language normalization.

### Canon Declaration

> **Canon Declaration:**  
>  
> The value pattern **Aggression (VA-AGGR-01)** has been evaluated against the Canon Promotion Checklist and is designated **Canon** within the *MOQ Values Matter* Atlas.  
>  
> Aggression is established as a **biological-level value pattern** describing arousal-based readiness for forceful action under perceived threat or boundary challenge, distinct from physical force execution and social enforcement mechanisms.
