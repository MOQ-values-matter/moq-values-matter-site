## 1. Neutral Definition

**Force** is a **physical value pattern** in which **direct physical action or constraint alters another pattern’s capacity to act**.

Force is recognized through **immediate, observable change in capability**, independent of intention, legitimacy, belief, or compliance.  
It operates by effect rather than agreement.

Force is a pattern of **execution**, not readiness, and not threat.

---

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 2  
Force originates as direct physical interaction that alters motion, access, position, or capacity.

### Biological — 1  
Biological systems enable the execution and endurance of force but do not generate its recognition as a value pattern.

### Social — 1  
Social systems constrain, authorize, distribute, or limit force but do not create it.

### Intellectual — 0  
Intellectual systems may plan, justify, or critique force but do not recognize or generate it.

**Primary level:** Physical

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Force originates at the **physical level** as direct interaction producing immediate alteration of capacity.

Recognition of force does not require:
- language
- norms
- authority
- threat
- compliance

Biological systems act **downstream**, supplying energy, coordination, and resilience for execution.

Social systems act **downstream**, stabilizing or distorting force by:
- regulating when it may occur
- assigning legitimacy or illegitimacy
- distributing responsibility for its application

Intellectual systems act **after the fact**, formalizing constraints or interpretations without generating force itself.

Force degrades when:
- symbolic assertion substitutes for physical effect
- force is applied without producing capacity change
- escalation exceeds containment benefit

Force remains coherent when:
- physical effect is proportional
- application is limited in scope and duration
- higher-level patterns resume once physical constraint is restored

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies  
Force increases predictability when applied consistently to enforce shared physical boundaries; inconsistency increases uncertainty and internal friction.

### Neutrals  
Force functions as a signal of boundary reality; excessive or erratic force increases avoidance and resistance.

### Adversaries  
Force directly alters adversary capacity and reliably produces counter-force, adaptation, or escalation.

### Internal Group Dynamics  
Persistent reliance on force reduces coordination and increases dependence on monitoring and control.

---

## 5. Persistence Logic

Force persists as a value pattern because physical interaction remains unavoidable in systems where:
- coordination fails
- coercion is ineffective
- immediate boundary violation occurs

The pattern re-emerges even when:
- socially condemned
- ideologically denied
- legally constrained

Force weakens or disappears when:
- coordination is stable
- coercion is sufficient
- contested capacity is removed

Persistence reflects **physical constraint dynamics**, not moral endorsement.

---

## 6. Empirical Evidence

### Physical  
- Direct interaction altering motion, access, or structure.

### Biological  
- Physical restraint, removal, or incapacitation across species.

### Social  
- Policing, confinement, and military action as physical execution layers beneath social order.

### Historical  
- Recurrent escalation to force following failure of norms, legitimacy, or coercion.

Across domains, force recurs as **capacity-altering interaction**, observable without agreement.

## 7. MOQ Coherence Verdict

Force increases MOQ coherence when:
- it halts immediate boundary violation
- it preserves conditions for higher-level coordination
- it withdraws once physical constraints are restored

Force degrades MOQ coherence when:
- it replaces coordination permanently
- escalation exceeds physical necessity
- application becomes chronic rather than terminal

Primary level placement remains **physical**.

---

## 8. Summary Schema

- **Primary MOQ level:** Physical  
- **Typical score profile:** P2 / B1 / S1 / I0  
- **Coherence type:** Terminal capacity enforcement  
- **Persistence drivers:** Coordination failure, coercion breakdown, boundary violation  
- **Common failure mode:** Escalatory counter-force  
- **Related patterns:** Aggression (Canon), Coercion (Canon), Enforcement, Power

---

## 9. Explicit Boundary Rejections

This entry does **not** define:

- **Aggression** — Force is execution, not biological readiness or arousal.
- **Coercion** — Force does not rely on threat, pressure, or compliance.
- **Legitimacy or authority** — Force operates regardless of justification.
- **Strategy or policy** — Force is not deliberative or planned abstraction.
- **Moral authority** — Force does not justify itself.

Reducing force to any of the above collapses physical recognition into higher-level patterns and obscures failure modes.

## 10. Canon Status & Revision Notes

**Current status:** Canon  

### Revision History

- **2026-01-18 — v1.0**  
  Canon Declaration issued following successful Canon Promotion Checklist evaluation and boundary validation against Aggression and Coercion.

## Canon Declaration

> **Canon Declaration:**  
>  
> The value pattern **Force (VA-FORC-01)** has been evaluated against the Canon Promotion Checklist and is designated **Canon** within the *MOQ Values Matter* Atlas.  
>  
> Force is established as a **physical-level value pattern** describing direct capacity-altering action, distinct from biological aggression and social coercion, and constrained by MOQ level directionality.
