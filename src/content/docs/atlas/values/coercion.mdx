## 1. Neutral Definition

**Coercion** is the value pattern in which a social system **enforces coordinated behavior through credible threat or imposed cost**, rather than through voluntary alignment, trust, or shared valuation.

The pattern is identified by **compliance under pressure**, where actors act to avoid loss rather than to realize shared value.

Coercion requires:

* a power asymmetry between enforcing and subjected nodes
* a credible threat of harm, loss, or exclusion
* behavioral compliance independent of internal agreement
* substitution of enforcement for voluntary coordination

Coercion is a **social enforcement pattern**, not violence itself, not fear, and not moral wrongdoing.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0

Physical systems do not impose meaningfully selective pressure through threat or sanction.

### Biological — 1

Biological fear and stress responses are activated by coercion, but do not generate the pattern.

### Social — 2

Coercion is a core social coordination mechanism used when trust, loyalty, or legitimacy are insufficient.

### Intellectual — 1

Intellectual systems formalize, justify, resist, or critique coercion after it is already operating.

**Primary level:** Social

---

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Coercion originates at the **social level**, where coordination must occur despite misaligned values or contested legitimacy.

Structurally, coercion functions as a **static quality bundle** imposed on value-bearing nodes that do not share direction, meaning, or commitment.

When coercion is active:

* behavior aligns without internal agreement
* value flow is externally redirected
* resistance is suppressed rather than resolved

Biological systems respond downstream through:

* fear activation
* stress loading
* avoidance and compliance bias

Intellectual systems respond downstream by:

* rationalizing coercion (law, ideology, necessity)
* contesting coercion (rights, ethics, dissent)
* formalizing coercion into doctrine or policy

Coercion preserves short-term coherence when:

* threats are credible and bounded
* enforcement capacity exceeds resistance
* alternative coordination mechanisms are unavailable

Coercion degrades coherence when:

* pressure exceeds tolerable stress
* value loss accumulates across nodes
* enforcement replaces legitimacy
* misalignment persists without resolution

Persistent coercion reliably generates **counter-pattern formation**.

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies (Enforcing Circles)

Enforcing systems experience:

* increased immediate compliance
* reduced need for consensus-building
* rising enforcement and monitoring costs over time

---

### Neutrals

Neutral observers typically:

* interpret coercion as instability signal
* delay alignment or commitment
* hedge against future enforcement exposure

---

### Adversaries / Subjected Circles

Subjected nodes or groups experience:

* stress accumulation
* loss of agency and value alignment
* strategic compliance without loyalty
* eventual resistance, exit, or sabotage

Coercion produces obedience, not allegiance.

---

### Internal Group Dynamics

Within coercive systems:

* trust decays
* surveillance increases
* signaling replaces meaning
* innovation and initiative decline

When coercion dominates coordination, **anti-pattern movements** predictably emerge.

---

## 5. Persistence Logic

Coercion persists because:

* value misalignment is common
* coordination is sometimes urgent
* trust and legitimacy require time to build

The pattern reappears even when:

* socially condemned
* ideologically denied
* formally constrained

Coercion weakens or disappears when:

* trust becomes cheaper than enforcement
* legitimacy restores voluntary alignment
* enforcement capacity collapses
* resistance cost exceeds compliance benefit

Persistence reflects coordination pressure, not moral endorsement.

## 6. Empirical Evidence

Observed recurrence includes:

### Anthropological

- Dominance hierarchies enforcing compliance absent shared valuation.
- Ritualized punishment maintaining order without consensus.

---

### Historical

- Empires relying on force where legitimacy failed.
- Collapse following overextension of coercive capacity.
- Revolts emerging after prolonged enforcement without value alignment.

---

### Sociological

- Policing and incarceration systems substituting for trust.
- High-coercion societies exhibiting low generalized trust.
- Enforcement escalation cycles under legitimacy erosion.

---

### Psychological

- Compliance driven by threat produces stress, resentment, and disengagement.
- Coerced behavior shows lower internalization and higher defection when pressure lifts.

---

### Contemporary

- Authoritarian governance achieving order at rising enforcement cost.
- Organizational burnout and resistance under micromanagement and threat-based control.
- Political radicalization following sustained coercive pressure.

Across domains, coercion consistently trades **short-term compliance for long-term fragility**.

## 7. MOQ Coherence Verdict

Coercion is a **high-impact social-level pattern** that enables coordination under value misalignment by imposing static order.

It increases coherence when:

* preventing immediate collapse
* containing acute conflict
* buying time for alternative alignment mechanisms

It degrades coherence when:

* normalized as default governance
* detached from legitimacy restoration
* allowed to accumulate unaddressed value loss

Coercion does not resolve value conflict.  
It suppresses it at measurable cost.

## 8. Summary Schema

* **Primary MOQ level:** Social
* **Typical score profile:** P0 / B1 / S2 / I1
* **Coherence type:** Enforcement-based / brittle
* **Persistence drivers:** Value misalignment, urgency, legitimacy failure
* **Common failure mode:** Resistance escalation, trust collapse
* **Related patterns:** Fear, Courage, Trust, Sacrifice, Power

---

## 9. Explicit Boundary Rejections

This entry does **not** define:

* moral evil or legitimacy
* violence itself
* fear as a value
* law or justice
* ideological domination

Coercion is not reducible to:

* brutality
* authority
* belief enforcement
* physical force alone

These framings obscure coercion’s role as **threat-backed coordination under misalignment**.

## Canon Declaration

> **Canon Declaration:**  
> This entry has been evaluated against the Canon Promotion Checklist (v1) and is designated **Canon** on the basis of clear social-level primacy, pre-justificatory recognizability, explicit structural failure modes, disciplined boundary rejection, and stable coherence under misalignment conditions.  
>  
> Coercion is established as a Canon social-level value pattern within the *MOQ Values Matter* Atlas.
