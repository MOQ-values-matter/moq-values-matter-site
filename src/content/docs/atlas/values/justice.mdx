## 1. Neutral Definition

Justice is the value pattern by which a social system **proportionally aligns roles, authority, responsibility, reward, and consequence** in order to sustain legitimacy and cooperation.

It is not moral righteousness, equality of outcome, or abstract fairness.  
Justice replaces revenge, arbitrariness, and domination with **rule-governed coordination** that allows large groups to function without constant coercion.

Justice manifests as:
- role-based allocation of rights and duties
- proportional reward and sanction
- predictable conflict resolution
- containment of arbitrary power
- shared procedures for adjudication
- institutionalized enforcement

Justice is a **system-level coordination pattern**, not an individual virtue and not an intellectual truth claim.

## 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

### Physical — 0  
Justice does not operate at the physical level; it requires agency, interpretation, and enforcement.

### Biological — 1  
Justice conditionally stabilizes biological behavior by reducing chronic threat, retaliatory cycles, and uncertainty, though enforcement may impose short-term biological costs.

### Social — 2  
Justice strongly stabilizes social systems by legitimizing authority, coordinating expectations, and resolving conflict without fragmentation.

### Intellectual — 1  
Justice relies on intellectual articulation (rules, procedures, reasoning) but does not generate truth or abstraction; intellectual formalism detached from social legitimacy degrades justice.

## 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

Justice primarily serves the **social level** by integrating restraint, risk-bearing, and judgment into durable structure.

- **Temperance** without justice becomes repression or uneven burdening.  
- **Courage** without justice becomes domination or vigilantism.  
- **Prudence** without justice becomes technocratic discretion without legitimacy.

Justice binds these patterns by:
- determining who restrains and when
- assigning who bears risk and cost
- adjudicating proportional response
- stabilizing expectations across actors

Justice becomes incoherent when:
- enforcement is selective
- power decouples from responsibility
- intellectual formalism overrides lived legitimacy
- procedure substitutes for proportionality

## 4. Relational Impact Map

### Allies  
Justice enables trust-based cooperation and reduces coordination costs for institutions and populations.

### Neutrals  
Justice signals predictability and legitimacy, attracting engagement and compliance.

### Adversaries  
Justice constrains opportunistic exploitation by raising the cost of arbitrariness and intimidation.

### Internal POV Group  
Justice legitimizes authority and sustains loyalty when applied proportionally; selective enforcement produces cynicism and decay.

## 5. Pattern Persistence Logic

Justice persists because it provides a **scalable alternative to violence-based order**.

Persistence drivers include:
- conflict resolution without escalation
- protection against arbitrary power
- expectation alignment across large populations
- institutional reinforcement through law and custom

Justice weakens when legitimacy erodes, proportionality collapses, or procedures are captured by power.

Persistence reflects functional necessity, not moral superiority.

## 6. Empirical Evidence

**Historical**
- Early legal codes replacing blood feuds
- Roman law enabling imperial-scale coordination
- Constitutional systems linking justice and legitimacy

**Anthropological**
- Universal presence of proportional sanction norms
- Council-based dispute resolution across cultures

**Sociological**
- Perceived injustice correlates with unrest and noncompliance

**Contemporary**
- Independent judiciaries
- Anti-corruption systems
- Organizational compliance frameworks

Justice consistently correlates with social stability.

---

## 7. MoQ Coherence Verdict

Justice is a **high-coherence social-level pattern** that preserves order by proportionally aligning authority, responsibility, and consequence.

It facilitates Dynamic Quality indirectly by:
- preventing power capture
- maintaining institutional bandwidth
- allowing reform without collapse

Justice becomes degenerative when intellectual formalism overrides legitimacy or enforcement becomes arbitrary.
