title: Canon Governance
description: How Canon is defined, maintained, and protected in MOQ Values Matter.
---

## Purpose

This document defines how **Canon** functions within the MOQ Values Matter project.

Canon exists to stabilize **high-quality intellectual patterns** once they have proven coherent, grounded, and explanatorily superior under current conditions.

Canon is not truth, doctrine, or ideology.
It is a mechanism for **preserving intellectual excellence without freezing inquiry**.

## Related Governance Documents

Canon governance operates together with the following documents:

- **Canon Promotion Checklist**  
  Defines the mandatory criteria for promoting an entry to Canon status.  
  → See: [/governance/canon-promotion-checklist/](/governance/canon-promotion-checklist/)

- **AI Instructions**  
  Defines how AI assistants must interpret and apply Canon rules, including strict constraints regarding Dynamic Quality and intellectual methods.  
  → See: `AI-INSTRUCTIONS.md` (repository root)

These documents are complementary.  
No single document defines Canon in isolation.

## What Canon Is

Canon is a collection of **stabilized intellectual-level static patterns**.

A Canon entry represents:
- a coherent explanation
- grounded in observable reality
- aligned across MOQ levels
- with known limits and failure modes
- judged superior to available alternatives

Canon entries persist because they have **earned stability**, not because they are final.

---

## What Canon Is Not

Canon is explicitly **not**:

- Ultimate truth
- Moral approval
- Consensus or popularity
- Institutional authority
- A method or framework
- A container for Dynamic Quality

Dynamic Quality cannot be defined, operationalized, or institutionalized.
Canon records *what remains* after Dynamic Quality has already passed and stabilized.

---

## Canon and the Metaphysics of Quality (MOQ)

In MOQ terms:

- Canon entries are **static intellectual patterns**
- They are subordinate to biological, social, and physical realities
- They must respect cross-level constraints
- They remain corrigible when higher-quality static patterns emerge

Canon does not claim metaphysical primacy.
It claims **functional excellence under present conditions**.

---

## Canon vs Exploration

The project distinguishes clearly between:

### Canon
- Stabilized
- Comparative
- Slow-changing
- Responsible
- Governed

### Exploration (Essays, Drafts, Methods)
- Provisional
- Creative
- Competing
- Fast-changing
- Ungoverned

Exploration may inform Canon.
Exploration may challenge Canon.
Exploration must not **redefine** Canon without passing governance rules.

---

## Canon Promotion

Promotion to Canon is a **deliberate act**, not an automatic consequence of writing.

An entry may be promoted to Canon only if:
- it follows the Canonical Value Atlas Entry structure
- it satisfies all criteria in the Canon Promotion Checklist
- its promotion is explicitly declared and documented

Canon promotion always involves:
- responsibility
- justification
- traceability

There are no silent promotions.

---

## Canon Revision

Canon is **stable, not frozen**.

Revisions to Canon entries are allowed when:
- new evidence emerges
- better explanatory patterns appear
- internal inconsistencies are discovered
- conditions materially change

All Canon revisions must:
- be documented in revision notes
- justify why stability is being disturbed
- preserve traceability of prior versions

Unjustified volatility is treated as quality degradation.

---

## Canon Authority

Canon authority derives from:
- coherence
- grounding
- explanatory power
- comparative superiority

It does **not** derive from:
- authorship
- institutional backing
- ideological alignment
- technical sophistication

Disagreement with Canon is permitted.
Replacement of Canon requires **higher-quality stabilization**, not argument alone.

---

## Methods and Frameworks

Analytical methods, lenses, and frameworks are **intellectual static patterns**.

They may:
- inform analysis
- clarify reasoning
- generate insights

They may not:
- override Canon verdicts
- redefine Canon structure
- substitute for cross-level coherence

Methods belong to **exploration**, not Canon, until they themselves stabilize.

---

## Governance Principle

> Canon exists to protect the project from premature certainty, ideological capture, and intellectual drift — not to prevent revision.

The burden of change lies with those who wish to disturb stability.
The burden of justification rises with the level of stability claimed.

---

## Closing Statement

Canon is a discipline of restraint.

It records the best intellectual patterns currently available,
while remaining open to their eventual replacement by better ones.

This balance — stability without dogma — is the core governance function of MOQ Values Matter.
