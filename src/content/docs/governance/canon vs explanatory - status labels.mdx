title: Canon vs Exploratory — Status Labels
description: A governance system defining the status of texts, diagrams, and ideas within the Circle / Ripple Theory project.
---

## Why a Status Label System Exists

Not all texts serve the same purpose.

Some establish **binding meaning**.  
Some explore **new possibilities**.  
Some translate Canon for specific audiences.

Without clear labels:
- exploratory ideas harden prematurely
- Canon erodes silently
- disagreements become semantic rather than substantive

This label system exists to:
- protect Canon integrity
- allow safe exploration
- make authorial intent explicit
- preserve Quality across time and contributors

---

## The Three Status Labels (Locked)

Every text, diagram, or artifact must carry **exactly one** of the following labels.

---

## 🟥 CANON

### Meaning
**Canon** artifacts define *binding concepts, terms, metaphors, and structures*.

They establish:
- authoritative definitions
- stable metaphors
- level distinctions
- non-relativist boundaries
- governance rules

Canon is **normative for the project**.

---

### Examples
- Essays 01–06
- Canon Glossary
- Diagram Key
- Governance documents
- Terminology rules

---

### Rules
- Canon cannot be casually edited
- Changes require explicit revision intent
- Canon terms must be used consistently everywhere else
- Canon conflicts override all other content

> Canon answers:  
> **“What does this project mean?”**

---

## 🟧 EXPLORATORY

### Meaning
**Exploratory** artifacts are spaces for:
- testing new metaphors
- extending the model
- probing edge cases
- integrating external ideas
- speculative applications

Exploratory work may:
- challenge Canon
- stretch metaphors
- introduce tentative language

But it is **not binding**.

---

### Examples
- draft essays
- speculative diagrams
- cross-framework experiments
- early notes
- thought experiments

---

### Rules
- Exploratory work must not redefine Canon terms
- Exploratory work must not silently contradict Canon
- If an idea stabilizes, it must be *explicitly promoted* to Canon

> Exploratory answers:  
> **“What might be possible?”**

---

## 🟦 APPLICATION (Optional but Recommended)

### Meaning
**Application** artifacts adapt Canon to:
- coaching
- leadership
- education
- media
- specific domains

Application simplifies language **without changing structure**.

---

### Examples
- executive guides
- coaching tools
- workshop materials
- public-facing summaries

---

### Rules
- Application must conform to Canon
- Simplification is allowed; reinterpretation is not
- If Application reveals ambiguity, Canon must be clarified

> Application answers:  
> **“How is this used here?”**

---

## Promotion & Demotion Rules

### From Exploratory → Canon
Promotion requires:
- explicit proposal
- alignment with existing Canon
- terminology review
- diagram compatibility check
- clear value increase

Nothing becomes Canon by accident.

---

### From Canon → Deprecated
If a Canon concept is replaced:
- it must be explicitly marked **Deprecated**
- references must be updated
- rationale must be documented

Silent removal is not allowed.

---

## Visual Labeling Standard

Every artifact should clearly display its status at the top:

```mdx
<!-- STATUS: CANON -->

or

<!-- STATUS: EXPLORATORY -->


or

<!-- STATUS: APPLICATION -->


Diagrams should include the label in:

title

footer

or metadata

Conflict Resolution Rule

If two texts conflict:

Canon overrides Exploratory

Canon overrides Application

Exploratory conflicts must be resolved before promotion

Application conflicts indicate misuse, not Canon error

Governance Principle

This system exists to preserve Quality over novelty.

Exploration is encouraged.
But meaning is protected.

Canon is what we stand on.
Exploratory is where we step forward.

Both are necessary.
Confusing them is not.
