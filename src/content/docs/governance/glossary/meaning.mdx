## Meaning

**Meaning** is the *felt coherence* that arises when value patterns align across levels.

Meaning is **not** a primary value pattern.  
It does not operate independently, nor does it possess its own persistence logic.

Instead, meaning emerges as an **experiential signal** of value coherence — biological, social, and intellectual — within an individual or group.

- High meaning typically indicates aligned values and functional coherence.
- Loss of meaning typically indicates value conflict, suppression, or breakdown.
- Artificial meaning often indicates narrative capture without supporting truth or integrity.

In **MOQ Values Matter**, meaning is treated as a **diagnostic outcome**, not a Canon object.

Meaning follows value.  
It does not ground it.
