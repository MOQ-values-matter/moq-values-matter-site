description: A one-page glossary defining the core terms used consistently across the Circle / Ripple Theory essays.

## Purpose of This Glossary

This glossary defines the **canonical meaning** of terms used in Essays 01–06.

Its purpose is to:
- ensure consistency across texts
- prevent conceptual drift
- protect against moral relativism and level collapse
- give contributors a shared language

If a term appears here, it must be used **with this meaning**.

## Core Value Terms

**Value**  
That which has Quality — what matters and propagates through actions and systems.

**Quality**  
Hierarchical value across MOQ levels; some values are objectively higher quality because they preserve more life, coherence, and stability over time.

**Dynamic Quality**  
The pre-conceptual source of novelty and emergence.  
Not explainable, not operationalized, only recognizable after the fact.

**Static Patterns**  
Stabilized forms of value at physical, biological, social, and intellectual levels.

---

## The Core Metaphor

**Value Node**  
An individual understood as a living point where value is received, integrated, and emitted.

**Becoming Value Node**  
The individual understood as a process, not a fixed entity — continuously shaped by past ripples and current context.

**Ripple / Value Ripple**  
The propagation of value effects caused by action, inaction, or presence.  
Ripples travel across levels and time, often beyond intent.

**Priming**  
The accumulated influence of past ripples that shapes perception, interpretation, and response.

**Value Field**  
An environment where value propagates, stabilizes, and decays.

---

## Circles and Fields

**Circle**  
A socially bound, multi-level anchored value field.  
Made real by people, resources, shared meaning, reciprocity, and enforcement.

**Zone of Value Resonance**  
A region within a circle where certain ripples are amplified, normalized, dampened, or suppressed.

**Keychain**  
The higher-order binding of circles into a larger social structure that carries accumulated human value and enforces shared constraints.

---

## MOQ Levels (Strict Usage)

**Physical Level**  
Matter, force, territory, infrastructure, tools, and material constraints.

**Biological Level**  
Life processes: fear, stress, bonding, aggression, exhaustion, vitality, competence.

**Social Level**  
Shared meaning, myth, loyalty, reciprocity, trust, exclusion, enforcement, power.

**Intellectual Level**  
Reasoning, inference, abstraction, learning from experience, coherence testing, error correction.

> **Rule:**  
> Stories, narratives, myths, and symbolic meaning are always **social**, never intellectual.

---

## Reciprocity, Power, and Stability

**Reciprocity**  
The structural expectation that contribution will be met with return and sacrifice will not be exploited.

**Reserves**  
Stored value buffers across levels (trust, capacity, margin, goodwill) that allow systems to absorb stress.

**Trust**  
The rational expectation that reciprocity holds.

**Power**  
A social-level pattern: the organized capacity to enforce boundaries and constrain behavior.

**Enforcement**  
The legitimate application of power to protect reciprocity and stability.

**Coercion**  
A lower-quality substitution for reciprocity, relying on fear and biological constraint.

---

## Breakdown and Repair

**Collapse**  
The failure of a value field due to reserve depletion and broken reciprocity.

**Repair**  
Costly re-patterning after breach; cannot reverse history, only rebuild under new constraints.

**Forgiveness**  
A structural risk decision to allow renewed participation despite justified expectation of harm.

**Re-entry**  
Conditional reintegration into a value field; never automatic, never cost-free.

---

## Moral Structure (Non-Relativism)

**Field-Relative Valuation**  
Actions alter real physical, biological, and social conditions.
Meaning and judgment follow; they do not create value.Value effects precede interpretation.

**Non-Relative Value Hierarchy**  
The principle that some values are objectively higher quality because they preserve more levels and reduce destructive ripple propagation.

> Local success does not imply high Quality.

## Final Note

This glossary is **Canon**.

If a term:
- is used differently,
- blurred across levels,
- or redefined without notice,

then the text is **out of alignment** with Circle / Ripple Theory.

When in doubt, return to this question:

> *Does this usage preserve clarity about value, responsibility, and consequence?*

If not, revise.
