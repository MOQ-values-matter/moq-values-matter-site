title: Scope and Boundaries
description: Defines what belongs in the Value Atlas, Essays, Methods, and nowhere within the MOQ Values Matter project.
---

## Purpose

This document defines **scope boundaries** within the MOQ Values Matter project.

Its purpose is to:
- prevent category errors
- protect Canon integrity
- avoid intellectual clutter
- ensure that different types of work evolve at appropriate speeds

Not all valuable thinking belongs in the same place.

---

## Core Distinction

The project distinguishes between **stabilized knowledge**, **exploratory thought**, and **analytical tooling**.

These serve different functions and must not be mixed.

---

## The Value Atlas

### What the Value Atlas Is

The Value Atlas contains **Canonical Value Patterns**.

These are:
- stabilized intellectual descriptions of recurring value patterns
- analyzed across MOQ levels
- grounded in observable reality
- governed by Canon rules

The Atlas exists to answer:

> “What value patterns reliably exist, and how do they function across levels?”

---

### What Belongs in the Value Atlas

An entry belongs in the Value Atlas if it:
- describes a **value pattern**, not an opinion
- can be analyzed across MOQ levels
- recurs across contexts, cultures, or systems
- is suitable for stabilization and comparison
- can plausibly earn Canon status

Examples:
- Justice
- Loyalty
- Trust
- Power
- Legitimacy
- Corruption
- Authority

---

### What Does *Not* Belong in the Value Atlas

The following do **not** belong in the Atlas:

- speculative theories
- personal reflections
- political advocacy
- methodological debates
- how-to guides
- narratives or storytelling
- emerging ideas without stabilization
- unresolved ideological positions

If an entry requires persuasion to be accepted, it does not belong here.

---

## Essays

### What Essays Are

Essays are the **exploratory space** of the project.

They exist to:
- think aloud
- test interpretations
- connect patterns
- challenge Canon
- synthesize insights
- explore implications

Essays may be:
- provisional
- personal
- speculative
- argumentative
- incomplete

They answer:

> “What might this mean?”  
> “How does this connect?”  
> “Where could this be wrong?”

---

### What Belongs in Essays

- interpretation of Atlas entries
- critique of Canon patterns
- synthesis across multiple values
- historical or contemporary analysis
- boundary-pushing ideas
- unresolved tensions
- perspective-based arguments

Essays may reference Canon.
They may challenge Canon.
They may never redefine Canon.

---

## Methods

### What Methods Are

Methods are **intellectual tools**, not truths.

They include:
- analytical lenses
- scoring heuristics
- comparison techniques
- diagnostic questions
- structured ways of reasoning

Methods are **static intellectual patterns**.
They are not Dynamic Quality.

Methods answer:

> “How are we looking?”  
> “What does this lens reveal?”  
> “What does it obscure?”

---

### What Belongs in Methods

- Golden Mean analyses
- coherence heuristics
- propagation analysis
- diagnostic frameworks
- evaluation techniques

Methods may:
- inform Essays
- support Atlas analysis
- be compared and critiqued

Methods must not:
- override Canon verdicts
- redefine Atlas structure
- claim authority by themselves

---

## What Belongs Nowhere (Yet)

Some things do not belong anywhere in the project — **yet**.

These include:
- raw intuition without articulation
- unresolved emotional reactions
- slogans or memes
- purely rhetorical positions
- premature abstractions
- ideas that cannot yet be examined

These may be valuable.
They are simply not ready.

They belong in:
- notebooks
- drafts
- conversations
- thinking

Not everything needs to be published.

---

## Boundary Enforcement Principle

When in doubt:

- Prefer **Essays** over Atlas
- Prefer **not publishing** over misplacing
- Prefer **restraint** over expansion

Moving something *into* the Atlas is always harder than leaving it outside.
This is intentional.

---

## Canon Protection Rule

> Nothing may enter the Value Atlas unless it can plausibly satisfy the Canon Promotion Checklist.

> Nothing may redefine Canon without explicit governance change.

This rule protects the Atlas from:
- ideological capture
- methodological dominance
- premature certainty
- intellectual entropy

---

## Closing Statement

The strength of MOQ Values Matter depends not on how much it includes,
but on how carefully it distinguishes.

Clarity of boundaries is a form of quality.
