# Canon Value Construction Method  
**MOQ Values Matter**

**Status:** Governing Method (Non-Canon)  
**Scope:** Applies to all Canon Value Atlas entries  
**Purpose:** Ensure consistency, coherence, and resistance to subjectivism, coercion, and ideology  

---

## 1. Purpose of the Canon Method

The Canon Method defines how value patterns are identified, described, evaluated, and promoted to Canon status within the *MOQ Values Matter* framework.

Canon entries are:
- **descriptive**, not prescriptive
- **functional**, not moralized
- **structural**, not ideological
- **revision-disciplined**, not expressive

The method exists to ensure that Canon values remain:
- cross-contextually stable
- level-coherent within the Metaphysics of Quality (MOQ)
- resistant to capture by subjectivity, power, or belief

This document does **not** define individual values.  
It defines the **procedure by which values are defined**.

---

## 2. What Counts as a Canon Value

A Canon value is a **recurrent value pattern** that:

1. Appears across cultures, contexts, and historical periods  
2. Produces predictable effects on coordination, selection, or stability  
3. Operates independently of individual preference or belief  
4. Exhibits identifiable failure modes  
5. Can be placed coherently within MOQ levels  

Values that depend primarily on:
- ideology
- doctrine
- moral exhortation
- subjective preference

are **not Canon-eligible**.

---

## 3. The Four Canon Anchors

Every Canon value entry must satisfy **all four anchors**.

### Anchor A — Pattern, Not Opinion
The value must describe a **selection or coordination pattern**, not a belief or preference.

A valid Canon value:
- persists even when contested
- can be observed without endorsement
- influences behavior through structure, not persuasion

If a value disappears when people disagree about it, it is not Canon-eligible.

---

### Anchor B — MOQ Level Discipline
Each Canon value must declare:

- **one and only one primary MOQ level**
- zero or more secondary levels

The primary level is where the value:
- originates
- is first stabilized
- performs its core function

Secondary levels may:
- constrain
- articulate
- amplify
- distort

They may **not** generate the value pattern.

“All-level” values are not permitted.

---

### Anchor C — Non-Coercive Recognition
A Canon value must be **recognizable without enforcement**.

Social enforcement may exist, but the value must:
- function prior to command
- operate without authority
- fail visibly when imposed without recognition

Values that exist only through coercion or instruction are not Canon-eligible.

---

### Anchor D — Real Failure Modes
Every Canon value must be able to **fail structurally**.

Failure modes must be:
- repeatable
- observable
- non-moralized
- non-exceptional

If a value cannot fail, it is not a value pattern; it is a slogan.

---

## 4. Canon Construction Pipeline

Canon entries are constructed using the following enforced sequence.

---

### Step 1 — Identify Pre-Justification Recognition

Determine the **earliest MOQ level** at which the value is recognized **prior to**:
- explanation
- social validation
- rule enforcement
- intellectual justification

Guidelines:
- Requires language → not biological
- Requires norms → not biological
- Requires reasoning → not intellectual
- Requires enforcement → not primary social

This step determines the **primary_level**.

---

### Step 2 — Functional Role per MOQ Level

For each MOQ level, answer **only**:

> What does this value *do* at this level?

Not:
- what people think it means
- what it symbolizes
- whether it is good or bad

Assign scores:
- **0** — no functional role
- **1** — secondary or supportive role
- **2** — core stabilizing role

Scores must reflect **function**, not importance.

---

### Step 3 — Enforce Directionality

Cross-level causation must follow MOQ directionality:

- Lower levels may enable higher ones  
- Higher levels may stabilize, distort, or formalize lower ones  
- Higher levels may **not create** lower-level recognition  

This rule prevents:
- social constructionism
- intellectual reductionism
- metaphysical leakage

---

### Step 4 — Replace Moral Claims with Functional Conditions

Canon language must avoid:
- praise
- teleology
- moral exhortation
- normative conclusion

Instead, all effects must be framed as:

- “When this pattern is active, systems tend to…”
- “This pattern degrades when…”

Canon entries describe **conditions and consequences**, not ideals.

---

### Step 5 — Empirical Anchoring (Descriptive Only)

Evidence must be framed as:
- observation
- recurrence
- cross-domain convergence

Evidence must **not**:
- justify the value
- prove it morally correct
- invoke metaphysical authority

All empirical sections must remain descriptive.

---

### Step 6 — Explicit Boundary Rejection

Each Canon entry must explicitly state what it is **not**, especially where confusion is likely.

At minimum, entries must reject:
- subjectivism (mere preference)
- reductionism (single-level collapse)
- ideological framing
- market-only framing (where applicable)

Boundary rejection is mandatory Canon hygiene.

---

## 5. Canon Entry Structure (Required, Normative)

Every Canon value entry must follow the structure below.  
Each section has a **specific analytical role** and **strict constraints**.  
Sections are not interchangeable, and content must not leak across them.

The purpose of this structure is to prevent:
- poetic drift
- moral inflation
- level collapse
- ideological framing
- repetition disguised as depth

---

### 1. Neutral Definition

**Purpose:**  
To state what the value pattern *is*, without argument, praise, or justification.

**Must do:**
- Define the value as a **pattern of selection, recognition, or coordination**
- Use descriptive, functional language
- Be readable without MOQ expertise
- Stand alone as a reference definition

**Must not:**
- Argue that the value is good, necessary, or superior
- Appeal to emotion, spirituality, or moral authority
- Invoke Dynamic Quality causally
- Depend on examples to make sense

**Validation question:**  
> Can this definition be quoted out of context without becoming ideological or vague?

---

### 2. Multi-Level Evaluation (0–2 per level)

**Purpose:**  
To assign the value’s **functional role** at each MOQ level.

**Must do:**
- Assign a score (0, 1, or 2) for *each* MOQ level
- Provide a one-sentence functional rationale per level
- Clearly identify the **primary level** (score = 2)

**Scoring rules:**
- **0** = no functional role at this level  
- **1** = secondary, supportive, or constraining role  
- **2** = core stabilizing or originating role  

**Must not:**
- Score based on importance, desirability, or moral weight
- Assign multiple primary levels
- Use metaphorical or evaluative language

**Validation question:**  
> If the value disappeared at this level, would the system still function essentially the same?

---

### 3. Multi-Level Coherence Analysis

**Purpose:**  
To explain how the value behaves **across levels without collapsing them**.

**Must do:**
- Describe how the value:
  - originates at its primary level
  - propagates upward or downward
  - is constrained, stabilized, or distorted by other levels
- Explicitly state **conditions of coherence** and **conditions of degradation**

**Must not:**
- Introduce new definitions
- Re-score levels
- Claim that higher levels generate lower-level recognition
- Invoke Dynamic Quality as a mechanism

**Validation question:**  
> Does this section preserve clear directionality between MOQ levels?

---

### 4. Relational Impact Map

**Purpose:**  
To describe how the value affects **interaction dynamics**, not moral character.

**Must do:**
- Analyze the value’s effects on:
  - allies
  - neutrals
  - adversaries
  - internal group dynamics
- Describe effects in terms of:
  - trust
  - coordination
  - predictability
  - attraction or resistance

**Must not:**
- Moralize actors
- Assume benevolent intent
- Describe outcomes as “deserved”
- Collapse relational impact into “good vs evil”

**Validation question:**  
> Could an adversary benefit from understanding this value’s effects?

---

### 5. Persistence Logic

**Purpose:**  
To explain **why the value pattern recurs and survives over time**.

**Must do:**
- Identify functional problems the value solves
- Explain persistence without appealing to tradition or morality
- Describe conditions under which the value weakens or disappears

**Must not:**
- Appeal to timelessness, destiny, or virtue
- Argue that persistence proves moral truth
- Confuse popularity with stability

**Validation question:**  
> If this value stopped being taught, would it still re-emerge—and why?

---

### 6. Empirical Evidence

**Purpose:**  
To anchor the value pattern in **observable reality**.

**Must do:**
- Use cross-domain evidence (biology, sociology, history, etc.)
- Frame evidence as:
  - observation → pattern → interpretation
- Demonstrate recurrence, not proof

**Must not:**
- Use evidence to justify moral claims
- Invoke authority as validation
- Cherry-pick cases that only support one framing

**Validation question:**  
> Do these observations remain meaningful even if the reader disagrees with the value?

---

### 7. MOQ Coherence Verdict

**Purpose:**  
To summarize the value’s **systemic role and limits** within MOQ.

**Must do:**
- State clearly:
  - when the value increases coherence
  - when it degrades coherence
- Reaffirm primary level placement
- Clarify relationship to adjacent values

**Must not:**
- Introduce new analysis
- Re-argue earlier sections
- Declare the value supreme or foundational

**Validation question:**  
> Does this verdict constrain misuse as much as it highlights function?

---

### 8. Summary Schema

**Purpose:**  
To provide a **compact reference abstraction**.

**Must do:**
- List:
  - primary level
  - typical score profile
  - coherence type
  - persistence drivers
  - common failure mode
  - related patterns
- Be scannable and unambiguous

**Must not:**
- Introduce nuance not present elsewhere
- Use poetic or metaphorical phrasing
- Replace earlier sections

**Validation question:**  
> Could this schema be used accurately without reading the full entry?

---

### 9. Explicit Boundary Rejections

**Purpose:**  
To prevent misinterpretation and ideological capture.

**Must do:**
- Explicitly reject common incorrect framings
- Name competing explanations the entry does *not* adopt
- Explain why those framings fail structurally

**Must not:**
- Strawman opposing views
- Engage in debate or rhetoric
- Introduce new positive claims

**Validation question:**  
> Does this section reduce future misuse or overextension?

---

### 10. Canon Status & Revision Notes

**Purpose:**  
To document governance, not content.

**Must do:**
- State current Canon status
- Record major reframings or level changes
- Include Canon Declaration when applicable

**Must not:**
- Contain analytical content
- Justify promotion rhetorically

**Validation question:**  
> Could this section be removed without changing the meaning of the value?

---

## Structural Invariant

A Canon entry is valid **only if**:
- Each section answers its own validation question
- No section performs another section’s function
- The entry remains intelligible when read non-linearly

Violation of structure is grounds for **Canon rejection or demotion**.


---

## 6. Canon Promotion Rules

A value may be promoted to Canon only if:

- All four Canon Anchors are satisfied  
- MOQ level placement is stable  
- Failure modes are explicit  
- Dynamic Quality is non-operational  
- Language remains descriptive and restrained  

Canon promotion requires **explicit approval** and a recorded Canon Declaration.

---

## 7. AI Enforcement Constraints (Abstract)

When generating or validating Canon entries, AI systems must enforce:

- Exactly one primary MOQ level
- No causal claims about Dynamic Quality
- No evaluative language without functional grounding
- Presence of failure modes
- Presence of boundary rejections
- Correct cross-level directionality

Entries failing these constraints must remain Draft.

---

## 8. Final Note

The Canon Method exists to protect the Atlas from:
- poetic drift
- moral inflation
- ideological capture
- reductionism
- authority substitution

It enables:
- stable reference
- cross-cultural analysis
- disciplined disagreement
- future expansion

The method governs **how values are described**, not **which values matter**.

---

*Canon constrains expression so that meaning can endure.*
