title: Master Diagram Legend — Circles, Ripples, and Value Flow
description: Unified visual grammar for Circle / Ripple Theory and Value Flow diagrams in MOQ Values Matter.
status: Operational
---

## Status and Purpose

This document defines the **master visual grammar** for all diagrams used in *MOQ Values Matter* essays that depict:

- individuals as value nodes
- circles as value fields
- ripples as value propagation
- static quality as retention (latching)
- coupling and re-coupling of value
- stagnation as loss of flow

This legend is **operational**, not Canon.
If a diagram and the written text disagree, **the text governs**.

The legend is grounded in Robert Pirsig’s **Metaphysics of Quality (MOQ)** and introduces **no new laws or value claims**.

---

## Foundational Assumptions

All diagrams using this legend assume:

1. **Quality is primary reality** (prior to subject–object division).
2. **Dynamic Quality** is the pre-conceptual source of novelty and better.
3. **Static quality patterns** latch Dynamic Quality into persistent forms.
4. Static patterns must **retain** value to persist.
5. Static patterns must also allow **coupling and re-coupling** for continued quality development.
6. Value moves:
   - upward across MOQ levels,
   - laterally between patterns,
   - diagonally across contexts,
   - temporally across generations.
7. No pattern exists in isolation.

These assumptions are not re-argued visually.

---

## Level Context (MOQ Stack)

All diagrams preserve the four static levels as **contextual planes**, not ladders:

- **Physical**
- **Biological**
- **Social**
- **Intellectual**

Rules:
- Levels describe *where* value stabilizes, not *what it means*.
- Higher levels depend on lower ones but do not subsume them.
- Diagrams must not imply inevitability or teleology.

---

## Dynamic Quality

**Symbol:** diffuse glow / soft gradient field  
**Meaning:** pre-conceptual source of novelty and better

**Rules**
- Never directional
- Never enclosed
- Never quantified
- Never diagrammed as a process or mechanism

Dynamic Quality may appear only as **background presence**.

---

## Static Quality Patterns

### Value Node (Individual)

**Symbol:** solid circle (●) with optional inner core  
**Meaning:** a living point where value is received, integrated, and emitted

- Outer ring = identity / boundary coherence
- Inner core = integrated preference (better vs worse)
- Optional halo = heightened activation or priming

Do not use squares for individuals.

---

### Circle (Group / Context)

**Symbol:** enclosing ring (◯) or rounded container  
**Meaning:** a **value field** where participation, reciprocity, and meaning operate

- A circle is not a membership list
- A circle is a **zone of resonance**

Examples:
- Family
- Team
- Community
- Institution
- Nation

---

### Static Pattern as Latch

**Symbol:** bounded structure (circle, container, institutional form)  
**Meaning:** stabilized memory of what has worked

**Visual properties**
- Boundary thickness = retention strength
- Interior glow = retained value
- Ports / openings = coupling capacity

Static patterns are **latches**, not conduits.

---

## Value Fields (Environment)

**Symbol:** soft region / low-opacity boundary  
**Meaning:** ambient shaping conditions (expectations, norms, pressure)

- Fields may overlap
- Fields may contain circles
- Fields may exist without formal institutions

---

## Value Flow

**Symbol:** bands or streams connecting nodes, circles, or patterns  
**Meaning:** value moving between stabilizations

**Properties**
- Width = available capacity
- Brightness = vitality (not moral value)
- Direction may be:
  - upward
  - lateral
  - diagonal

Absence of arrows implies non-deterministic flow.

---

## Ripples (Value Propagation)

### Ripple Ring

**Symbol:** concentric expanding rings (◎ ◎ ◎)  
**Meaning:** propagation of value effects across multiple levels

- Near rings = immediate effects
- Far rings = delayed or distributed effects

---

### Shock Ripple

**Symbol:** intensified first ring with glow  
**Meaning:** disruptive event that primes multiple nodes or circles

Use for:
- violence
- betrayal
- institutional rupture
- sudden loss

---

### Counter-Ripple

**Symbol:** ripple originating elsewhere and returning  
**Meaning:** feedback, retaliation, sanctions, narrative reversal

Every counter-ripple must have a visible source.

---

## Retention States

### Healthy Retention

- Balanced in/out flow
- Multiple active coupling paths
- Stable surrounding field

---

### Biased Retention

- Inbound flow exceeds outbound
- Internal stabilization increases
- Coupling narrows

Not yet stagnation.

---

### Self-Referential Retention (Stagnation)

- Value circulates internally
- External coupling collapses
- Re-coupling elsewhere becomes improbable

**Visual cues**
- Closed internal loops
- Fading or severed external links
- Dimming surrounding field

> Stagnation is defined structurally, not morally.

---

## Coupling and Re-Coupling

### Coupling Port

**Symbol:** opening or connector on a boundary  
**Meaning:** capacity for value to stabilize elsewhere

- Availability matters more than size
- Ports may be dormant or active

---

### Re-Coupling Event

**Symbol:** value flow leaving one pattern and stabilizing in another  
**Meaning:** continuation of quality in new form

Re-coupling is the **primary visual indicator of system health**.

---

## Connections

### Participation Link

**Symbol:** line from value node to circle boundary  
**Meaning:** embedded participation

- Solid: active participation
- Dashed: unstable / partial
- Dotted: latent / historical

---

### Bridge Link

**Symbol:** line connecting circles  
**Meaning:** shared members, resources, narratives, or risk

---

## Clusters (Reading Rule)

Clusters are read as:

> **Retention–coupling profiles**, not moral categories.

They show:
- where value pools
- how tightly it is retained
- how easily it reappears elsewhere

Use structural descriptors only:
- open
- biased
- closed
- brittle
- resilient

---

## Diagram Hygiene Rules

1. Every ripple must have a source.
2. Every strong reaction must have a priming path.
3. Retention must be visually distinct from blockage.
4. Closed loops represent self-referential retention only.
5. Diagrams must not introduce new laws or redefine MOQ hierarchy.

---

## Minimal Symbol Set

- ● value node (individual)
- ◯ circle (group / value field)
- ▢ soft region (environment)
- ◎ ripple (propagation)
- ─ ┄ ┈ connection (solid / dashed / dotted)
- Flow band — value movement
- Closed loop — stagnation
- Diffuse glow — Dynamic Quality

---

## Boundary Declaration

These diagrams visualize **structural conditions** for value flow, retention, and coupling.

They do **not**:
- define Quality,
- predict outcomes,
- assign moral worth,
- introduce Canon claims.

They exist to make **value dynamics visible without moralization**.
