title: Diagram Legend — Circle / Ripple Visual Language
description: One-page legend that standardizes the symbols, line styles, and level colors used across Circle / Ripple Theory diagrams in MOQ Values Matter.
---

## Status and Purpose

This legend defines the **visual grammar** for Circle / Ripple Theory diagrams used in the `essays/circle-theory/` section.

It is **operational** (a consistency tool), not a Canon claim.
If a diagram and the written text disagree, **the text governs**.

---

## Level Colors (MOQ Stack)

All diagrams must preserve the same level mapping.

**Background**
- Page background: dark gradient (night-sky)
  - `#05060b → #0b1020`

**Accent / Energy (Value flow)**
- Neon gradient (used for ripples, “energy”, emphasis, and Dynamic Quality glow):
  - `#00e5ff → #a855f7 → #ff4fd8`

**Static level fills (stack panels / zones)**
Use these as the default “level band” fills (or close neighbors if needed for contrast):

- **Physical (Inorganic):** `#081020`  
- **Biological:** `#0a1428`  
- **Social:** `#0c1730`  
- **Intellectual:** `#0d1a34`

**Text**
- Primary text: `#e8eefc`
- Secondary text: `#c7d2ee` or `#a9b6d8`

> Rule: **Do not invent new level colors**. If a diagram needs stronger differentiation, adjust opacity, stroke weight, or local glow — not the mapping.

## Core Entities

### Value Node (Individual)
**Symbol:** circle (●) with optional inner core  
**Meaning:** a living point where value is received, sorted, and emitted.

- Outer ring = boundary / identity coherence
- Inner core = “compass” / integrated preference (better vs worse)
- Optional halo = high activation / heightened priming

**Do not use:** squares for individuals (squares are reserved for structures/containers).

---

### Circle (Group / Context)
**Symbol:** enclosing ring (◯) or rounded container  
**Meaning:** a **zone of resonance** where ripples are amplified, dampened, or redirected.

- A circle is not “a list of members”
- A circle is the **field region** where participation becomes meaningful

**Label format (recommended):**
- `Family`
- `Team`
- `Gang A`
- `Community`
- `Institution`
- `Nation`

---

### Value Field (Environment)
**Symbol:** soft rectangle / soft boundary region (rounded) with low opacity  
**Meaning:** the **ambient shaping environment** (conditions + expectations) in which circles operate.

- Fields can overlap
- Fields can contain circles
- A field can exist without a named institution (e.g., “neighborhood climate”)

---

## Ripples (Value Propagation)

### Ripple Ring
**Symbol:** concentric rings radiating from a node or event (◎ ◎ ◎)  
**Meaning:** propagation of value effects across **all levels** (physical → intellectual).

**Ring interpretation**
- Near rings: immediate effects (high intensity, low latency)
- Far rings: delayed or distributed effects (lower intensity, wider spread)

**Styling rules**
- Use neon gradient strokes for “live” propagation
- Opacity decreases with distance
- Line weight decreases with distance (unless showing escalation)

---

### Shock Ripple (Disruption / High-impact event)
**Symbol:** ripple with stronger first ring + subtle glow  
**Meaning:** discontinuity that primes multiple circles and nodes.

Use for:
- violence
- betrayal
- sudden loss
- public exposure
- institutional rupture

---

### Counter-ripple (Reaction / Feedback)
**Symbol:** ripple originating from another node/circle returning into the scene  
**Meaning:** response energy building elsewhere and returning (retaliation, sanctions, mobilization, narrative reversal).

**Rule:** counter-ripples must have a visible source, not “from nowhere”.

---

## Connections Between Nodes and Circles

### Participation Link
**Symbol:** line from node to circle boundary  
**Meaning:** the node is **embedded** and participates in that circle’s field.

**Line styles**
- **Solid:** active commitment / ongoing participation
- **Dashed:** partial participation / unstable belonging
- **Dotted:** latent tie (history, kinship, reputation, “known of”)

---

### Bridge Link (Cross-circle coupling)
**Symbol:** line connecting circles (or their boundaries)  
**Meaning:** shared members, shared resources, shared narratives, shared risks.

Use when:
- a person belongs to multiple circles
- circles influence each other indirectly through overlap
- a ripple crosses into adjacent contexts

---

## Direction and Time

### Time Arrow
**Symbol:** arrow (→) or timeline bar  
**Meaning:** sequence, accumulation, or delayed consequence.

Use sparingly:
- only when time dependence is central to the point

---

### Stored Ripple (Reputation / Memory / Accumulated trust or fear)
**Symbol:** faint persistent rings around a node/circle  
**Meaning:** residue of past actions that continues to prime interpretation.

- Faint = long-term background residue
- Brighter = recent memory or heightened salience

---

## Meaning Without Moral Confusion

Diagrams may show that the *same action* is read differently across circles:

- “Hero” inside one circle
- “Evil” in another circle

**Rule:** show this as **field-relative evaluation** (labels, color emphasis, arrows), not as moral relativism.

Recommended technique:
- label two interpretation zones:
  - `In-circle valuation`
  - `Out-circle valuation`
- show the ripple and the counter-ripple explicitly

---

## Diagram Hygiene Rules

1. **Every ripple must have a source.**
2. **Every strong reaction must have a visible priming path** (ripple or stored ripple).
3. Prefer **fewer symbols** with clearer meaning over dense decoration.
4. Never use visuals to “smuggle” new laws or redefine MOQ hierarchy.
5. If a diagram introduces a new symbol, it must be added to this legend.

## Minimal Symbol Set (for quick consistency)

- ● value node (individual)
- ◯ circle (group / resonance zone)
- ▢ soft region (field / environment)
- ◎ ripples (propagation)
- ─ ┄ ┈ connection (solid / dashed / dotted)
- → time / causal direction (only when essential)
